envision an ai supported app where you can upload an excel file and it will create a database and a web interfaces for it. It will identify datasource and suggested alternative approaches for collecting those data. 

Then consider the data security aspect. 

So data has to stay on your machine,

Use agentic ai on your machine and instruct it to never upload the data to any cloud service, nore it self but instead construct scripts locally to mask the data before llm analysis.

Then make ai build client side app where the excek file can get upload and ask it to repeately remove control the browser using browser automation tools like playwright.
