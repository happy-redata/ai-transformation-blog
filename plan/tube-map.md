# Blog Series Plan: MetroFlow for Dummies

**Series Title:** MetroFlow for Dummies: Visualizing Business Processes Like the London Tube  
**Working Title (Danish):** MetroFlow for Dummies: Visualisér Forretningsprocesser som London-metroen  
**Target Audience:** Business leaders, process owners, digital transformation leads, operations managers  
**L-Level:** L100-L200 (accessible to non-technical readers, practical for practitioners)  
**Core Metaphor:** The London Underground map—Harry Beck's revolutionary 1931 design that ignored geography to focus on what matters: connections.

---

## Series Overview

This series introduces the concept of **topological mapping** for business processes—applying the same visual principles that made the London Tube map iconic to the messy world of workflows, approvals, and handovers.

**The Problem We Solve:**  
Most business flowcharts are "geographical"—they try to fit everything on one page based on who sits next to whom, resulting in spaghetti diagrams that nobody reads. By using topological principles, we create maps that:
- Prioritize **flow** over hierarchy
- Make **bottlenecks** immediately visible
- Enable **onboarding** in minutes instead of weeks

## Episode Structure (5 Episodes)

### Episode 1: Harry Beck's Revolution
**Title (DA):** Harry Becks Revolution: Geniet bag London-metroen  
**Title (EN):** Harry Beck's Revolution: The Genius Behind the London Tube Map  
**Published:** 2025-10-07

**Synopsis:**  
In 1931, an electrical draftsman named Harry Beck created a map that changed navigation forever. He ignored geography. He embraced simplicity. And he invented a visual language that every metro system in the world now copies.

This episode introduces the **topological vs. topographical** distinction using the London Tube as our anchor metaphor. We explore Beck's three revolutionary constraints:
- Lines at 0°, 45°, or 90° only
- Equidistant stations regardless of real distance
- Connections matter; geography doesn't

**Key Takeaway:** The genius of Beck's map isn't what it shows—it's what it *hides*.

**Visual Asset:** Side-by-side comparison of geographical London vs. Beck's schematic version.

### Episode 2: From Stations to Business Steps
**Title (DA):** Fra Stationer til Forretningsprocesser: Den Visuelle Ordbog  
**Title (EN):** From Stations to Business Steps: The Visual Dictionary  
**Published:** 2025-10-14

**Synopsis:**  
How do you translate Tube concepts into business language? This episode establishes the core mapping:

| Tube Element | Business Equivalent |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Line | Department / Workflow |
| Station | Task / Step |
| Interchange | Handover / Approval |
| Zone | Phase / Milestone |
| "You Are Here" | Current Status |

We walk through a real example: **Onboarding a New Employee**—showing how the traditional flowchart becomes unreadable versus how MetroFlow renders it clean and scannable.

**Key Takeaway:** Every business process is secretly a transit system waiting to be mapped.

**Visual Asset:** AI-generated Metro-style diagram of employee onboarding.

### Episode 3: The Beck Constraints
**Title (DA):** Beck-Reglerne: Hvorfor Begrænsninger Skaber Klarhed  
**Title (EN):** The Beck Constraints: Why Limitations Create Clarity  
**Published:** 2025-10-21

**Synopsis:**  
Harry Beck didn't just draw a map—he invented a design system. This episode explores the four rules that make topological diagrams work:

1. **Orthogonal Constraint:** Lines at 45/90 degrees only  
2. **Grid Snapping:** Stations align to an invisible grid  
3. **Distance Compression:** 3 weeks or 3 minutes = same visual length  
4. **Interchange Prioritization:** Handover points are visually emphasized

We show how applying these rules to a chaotic "Request for Proposal" process transforms it from spaghetti to subway.

**Key Takeaway:** Constraints are not limitations—they're superpowers for clarity.

**Visual Asset:** Before/after comparison of RFP process diagram.

### Episode 4: Finding Your Bottlenecks
**Title (DA):** Find Dine Flaskehalse: Når Fire Linjer Mødes  
**Title (EN):** Finding Your Bottlenecks: When Four Lines Converge  
**Published:** 2025-10-28

**Synopsis:**  
The most powerful insight from Metro-style mapping is immediate bottleneck visualization. When four colored lines converge at a single interchange, you're looking at a high-risk point in your organization.

This episode teaches readers to:
- Identify "King's Cross" nodes (where everything converges)
- Recognize "Aldwych" dead ends (abandoned processes)
- Spot "Circle Line" loops (endless approval cycles)

We analyze common business patterns:
- The CFO Approval Bottleneck
- The Legal Review Traffic Jam
- The IT Handover Black Hole

**Key Takeaway:** If four colors meet, someone is overwhelmed.

**Visual Asset:** Annotated diagram showing typical business bottleneck patterns.

### Episode 5: Building Your Own MetroFlow
**Title (DA):** Byg Din Egen MetroFlow: Fra Idé til Implementering  
**Title (EN):** Building Your Own MetroFlow: From Idea to Implementation  
**Published:** 2025-11-04

**Synopsis:**  
The final episode is hands-on. We guide readers through creating their first Metro-style process map:

**Step 1: Inventory Your Lines**  
List your core workflows/departments. Assign colors.

**Step 2: Plot Your Stations**  
Identify every task/step. Don't filter—include everything.

**Step 3: Mark Your Interchanges**  
Where do handovers happen? These become your circles.

**Step 4: Apply the Beck Rules**  
Force the mess into 45-degree angles. Compress time. Expand clarity.

**Step 5: Share and Iterate**  
Put it on the wall. Ask: "Is this how we really work?"

We provide a suggested tool stack (Miro, FigJam, or dedicated apps) and a downloadable template.

**Key Takeaway:** Your first Metro map will be wrong. That's the point—now you can see what to fix.

**Visual Asset:** Step-by-step visual guide with template preview.
