Welcome to **MetroFlow for Dummies** — your guide to visualizing business processes like a transit map.

In this series, we take you on a journey from Harry Beck's revolutionary 1931 design to practical implementation in your own organization:

1. **Harry Beck's Revolution** — The genius behind the London Tube map
2. **From Stations to Business Steps** — The visual dictionary
3. **The Beck Constraints** — Why limitations create clarity
4. **Finding Your Bottlenecks** — When four lines converge
5. **Building Your Own MetroFlow** — From idea to implementation

**Core metaphor:** *The London Tube map* — Harry Beck ignored geography to focus on what truly matters: connections.

Each episode builds on the previous, giving you a solid understanding of topological process visualization.
