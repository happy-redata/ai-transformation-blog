<Speak>Welcome to the second episode in the Agentic A-I for Dummies series. Today we learn the art of talking to A-I — and how you can let the A-I write the perfect prompts for you.</Speak>

You've installed <Voice text="GitHub Co-pilot">GitHub Copilot</Voice>. You're ready to build something amazing. You type:

*"Make an app for me"*

And the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> responds with... something. Maybe a Hello World. Maybe a half-finished template. But not what you imagined.

**Welcome to prompt engineering.**

## Why "Make an App" Never Works

Imagine asking an architect to "build a house". The architect would naturally ask:

- How many rooms?
- What style?
- What's the budget?
- Who will live there?

Without these details, you get... something. But probably not what you imagined.

The same applies to <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice>. The more specific your instruction, the better the result.

## The Anatomy of a Prompt

A good prompt has three parts:

### 1. Context — Who are you talking to?

*"You are an experienced TypeScript developer building a modern React application with Next.js."*

### 2. Instruction — What should happen?

*"Create a component that displays a user's profile card with name, picture, and a short biography."*

### 3. Constraints — What are the boundaries?

*"Use Tailwind CSS for styling. The component should be responsive and accessible. No external dependencies."*

<View>
Combined, it looks like this:
</View>

```
You are an experienced TypeScript developer building a modern 
React application with Next.js.

Create a component that displays a user's profile card with 
name, picture, and a short biography.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling. The component should be 
responsive and accessible. No external dependencies.
```

Now the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> has enough information to give a qualified answer.

## The Genius Trick: Let the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> Write Your Prompts

Here's the secret most people miss:

> **You don't need to be good at writing prompts. You just need to ask the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> to help you with that.**

Try this:

*"I want to build a countdown timer for an event. Help me formulate a detailed specification that a developer can use to implement it."*

The <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> will respond with something like:

```
## Countdown Timer Specification

### Overview
A visual countdown timer that shows time until a specified 
future event.

### Functional requirements
1. Display days, hours, minutes, and seconds
2. Update in real-time (every second)
3. Show a message when the event is reached
4. Allow configuration of event date via props

### Technical requirements
- React functional component with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Pure CSS animation (no heavy libraries)
- Responsive design

### Edge cases
- Handling past dates
- Timezones
- Browser focus (pause when tab is inactive?)
```

Now you have a specification you can use. You can even give it *back* to the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> and say: *"Implement this specification."*

## From Idea to Digital Product: Step-by-Step

Here's the complete workflow:

### Step 1: Describe your dream

Start with natural language. No technical terms necessary.

*"I want a website where you can keep track of which books you've read."*

### Step 2: Ask the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> for a specification

*"Help me create a detailed technical specification for this idea. Include data model, user flow, and technology choices."*

### Step 3: Review and adjust

Read the specification. Add, remove, adjust. Is there something you don't understand? Ask the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice>:

*"Explain why you chose PostgreSQL over SQLite for this project."*

### Step 4: Let the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> implement

*"Implement step 1 from the specification: The data model in Prisma."*

### Step 5: Iterate with feedback

*"Add a field for 'rating' on the book model. It should be a number between 1 and 5."*

Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have a finished product.

## Practical Example: A Simple Countdown

Let's go through the process from start to finish.

### Idea (natural language)
*"I want a timer that counts down to New Year's."*

### Prompt for specification
*"I want to build a New Year's countdown timer in React. Create a detailed specification."*

### The <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice>'s specification
```
## New Year's Countdown Specification

### Component: NewYearCountdown

**Props:**
- targetYear: number (default: next year)

**Display:**
- Days, hours, minutes, seconds in separate boxes
- Festive styling with confetti effect at New Year's
- "Happy New Year!" message when countdown is complete

**Technical details:**
- useState for time values
- useEffect with 1-second interval
- Cleanup on unmount
```

### Prompt for implementation
*"Implement the NewYearCountdown component based on this specification."*

### Result
A working React component, ready to use.

## Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Too vague** | "Make something cool" → random output | Be specific about features and style |
| **Too detailed** | 2000 words → confused <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> | Build up in steps, not all at once |
| **No iteration** | Accepts first suggestion | Ask for alternatives, improve continuously |
| **No verification** | "It looks right" | Always test the code, read it through |

---

## Specification Templates

Here are three templates you can reuse:

### For new features
*"I have an existing [type of app] in [technology]. Help me specify a new feature: [description]. Include integration with existing code."*

### For refactoring
*"Analyze this code: [insert code]. Identify improvements and suggest a refactoring plan."*

### For debugging
*"I'm getting this error: [error message]. Context: [what the code is trying to do]. Help me find and fix the problem."*

## Summary

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "Make an app for me" | Context + Instruction + Constraints |
| Struggling to formulate prompts | Letting the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> help with the specification |
| Accepting first suggestion | Iterating and improving continuously |
| Hoping it works | Always verifying and testing |

**Bottom line:** The hardest thing about using <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> isn't the technology — it's knowing what to ask for. But here's the secret: You can ask the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> to help you with *that* too.

In the next episode, we introduce **GitHub** — the platform where code lives, is collaborated on, and automatically deployed. Repositories, Issues, Pull Requests, and Actions: All the building blocks you need to work professionally with <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice>.

*What if your next project description wasn't written by you — but by the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> itself, based on your dreams?*
