<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
We all know the story of the poisoned apple. But medieval poisoners were far more cunning. They didn't just pour arsenic in the soup.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

No, they sent a gift. A sealed barrel of the finest French wine, supposedly from an allied duke. Who would suspect a gift?

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
This is exactly what hackers do today. We call it **Phishing** or **Supply Chain Attacks**.
</Speaker>

## The Three Classic Disguises

Just as the assassin of old rarely walked in the front door with a dagger, modern attacks often come in disguise. The Cupbearer (your security system) must know them all:

1.  **The False Messenger (Phishing):**
    An email that looks like it comes from your boss: *"Can you pay this invoice?"*. This is the equivalent of a fake herald wearing the King's colors.

2.  **The Poisoned Gift (Malware):**
    You download a free program ("Get free PDF reader"). It works fine, but inside hides a spy.

*Figure 1: Just like Odysseus' horse (or here, a barrel), the threat often comes wrapped in something we trust.*

3.  **The Water Supply (Supply Chain):**
    Why poison the King's cup if you can poison the well? If hackers can infect a software update trusted by thousands of companies, they don't need to break into each one individually.

## The Cupbearer's Laboratory

A good Cupbearer doesn't just taste. He examines.

<Voice text="Defender X.D.R.">Defender XDR</Voice> is our modern laboratory. It doesn't just look at the file (the glass). It looks at behavior:
*   *"Why does the calculator want access to the internet?"*
*   *"Why is the CEO logging in from a basement in Ukraine?"*

<SoundEffect name="success-chime" />

If something acts strangely, the system raises the alarm. It's like noticing the wine changing color when it touches silver.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Criminals get smarter every day. But so do our tools. It is a constant arms race between the poisoner and the cupbearer.

*Next week, we tighten the net. Because what if the threat doesn't come from outside? What if it's the cook we can't trust? Read Part 3: "Trust No One".*
