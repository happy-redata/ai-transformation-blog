After the last episode, you might be feeling anxious about your organization's "Lars problem."

Good. That anxiety can motivate action.

But here's the good news: **You don't need perfect documentation. You need enough.**

This episode is about practical, minimum viable documentation that could save you when the crisis hits.

## The Documentation Debt Concept

**Technical debt** is a common term: Shortcuts taken during development that cost more to fix later.

**Documentation debt** is similar: Every piece of knowledge that exists only in someone's head is debt accumulating interest.

The interest compounds:
- Year 1: "I should document this"
- Year 2: "I'll do it when I have time"
- Year 3: "I've forgotten half of why I built it this way"
- Year 4: Budget for a complete rewrite

## The Minimum Viable Documentation

You don't need 50-page technical specifications. You need the essentials:

### The App Card

One page (or one SharePoint item) per app:

```
APP NAME: Customer Inspection Tracker
STATUS: Production
OWNER: Sarah Jensen (sarah@company.com)
BACKUP OWNER: Mike Chen (mike@company.com)
BUILT: March 2024
LAST UPDATED: January 2026

PURPOSE:
Field technicians record inspection results and photos.

USERS:
- Field Services team (25 people)
- Quality Manager (view-only)

DATA SOURCES:
- SharePoint: "Inspections" list
- SharePoint: "Customers" list
- OneDrive: Photo storage folder

CONNECTED FLOWS:
- "Inspection Submitted" (sends email to Quality Manager)
- "Daily Summary" (scheduled at 6 PM)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Slow loading if more than 50 photos cached
- GPS doesn't work offline

NEXT REVIEW: July 2026
```

**Time to create:** 15 minutes  
**Value when crisis hits:** Priceless

### The Connection Map

For each app, list what connects to it:

```
Customer Inspection Tracker
├── DEPENDS ON:
│   ├── SharePoint: Inspections list
│   ├── SharePoint: Customers list
│   └── OneDrive: TechPhotos folder
│
├── TRIGGERED BY:
│   └── Power Apps button press
│
└── TRIGGERS:
    ├── Flow: "Inspection Submitted" 
    │   └── Sends email to quality@company.com
    └── Flow: "Daily Summary"
        └── Creates SharePoint list item
```

### The "Why We Did It This Way" Notes

For complex logic, explain the *why*, not just the *what*:

```
DATE FILTER LOGIC:
The 45-day lookback window exists because:
- Customer contract SLA requires inspections within 30 days
- 15-day buffer accounts for processing delays
- Discussed with Legal in March 2024 (email thread attached)

DO NOT change without Legal approval.
```

These notes are often more valuable than the code itself.

## The Documentation Toolkit

Keep it simple. Use tools you already have:

### Option 1: SharePoint List

Create a "Low-Code App Registry" list:
- App Name
- Status (Active/Retired/In Development)
- Owner
- Backup Owner
- Purpose (multiline text)
- Data Sources (multiline text)
- Connected Flows (multiline text)
- Last Review Date

**Pros:** Searchable, shareable, familiar  
**Cons:** Limited space for complex documentation

### Option 2: OneNote/Confluence Wiki

Create a notebook with:
- Section per department
- Page per app
- Structured template

**Pros:** Unlimited space, rich formatting  
**Cons:** Can become disorganized

### Option 3: README Files in Solutions

For Power Platform:
- Include a README file in each solution
- Version-controlled with the app
- Visible during deployment

**Pros:** Documentation travels with the app  
**Cons:** Not visible to non-technical users

### Option 4: In-App Documentation

For Canvas Apps:
- Add a "Help" or "About" screen
- Document key logic in comments
- Include contact information

**Pros:** Always accessible to users  
**Cons:** Takes development time

## The Documentation Sprint

If you're starting from zero, here's a rapid approach:

### Week 1: Inventory

1. List every Power App, Flow, and report
2. Identify the owner of each
3. Flag "mystery apps" with unknown owners

**Goal:** Know what you have

### Week 2: Prioritize

Rate each app:
- **Critical:** Business stops if it fails
- **Important:** Significant impact
- **Convenience:** Nice to have

**Goal:** Know what matters most

### Week 3-4: Document Critical Apps

For each "Critical" app:
1. Create an App Card
2. Map connections
3. Document known issues
4. Identify backup owner

**Goal:** Critical apps are survivable

### Month 2-3: Important Apps

Repeat for "Important" apps.

### Ongoing: Maintenance

- Review documentation quarterly
- Update when apps change
- Train new team members

## The Tools That Help (With AI)

In 2026, you don't have to document alone:

### Power Platform Documentation Generator

Microsoft's built-in tools:
- Solution Checker: Automated code review
- Power Platform CLI: Export solution metadata
- CoE Starter Kit: Inventory and governance tools

### AI-Assisted Documentation

Tools like GitHub Copilot or Azure AI can:
- Generate descriptions from code
- Explain complex formulas
- Suggest documentation improvements

**Reality check:** AI helps, but human knowledge of *context* and *why* is still essential.

### Copilot for Power Platform

Microsoft's built-in AI can:
- Explain what a flow does
- Describe app components
- Suggest improvements

Use it — but verify the output.

## The Documentation Culture

Tools aren't enough. You need habits:

### Rule: No Deployment Without Documentation

Before any app goes to production:
- App Card exists
- Owner is assigned
- Data sources are listed

If it's not documented, it's not ready.

### Rule: Monthly Documentation Hour

Block one hour monthly:
- Review your apps
- Update documentation
- Archive retired apps

Make it non-negotiable.

### Rule: Transfer Documentation

When someone leaves:
- Mandatory documentation review
- Handover to backup owner
- Update all App Cards

No exceptions.

## The Payoff

Organizations that invest in documentation:
- Recover faster from outages
- Onboard new team members quickly
- Identify redundant systems
- Make informed decisions about upgrades
- Avoid expensive rewrites

The ROI is difficult to measure — until you need it.

Documentation is about survival. Episode 14 is about thriving: Building a **Governance Framework** that makes sustainable low-code development possible.
