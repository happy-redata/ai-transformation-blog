"Let your imagination run free!"

That's the advice we get when we're supposed to be creative. No boundaries. No rules. Just draw what you feel.

And that's exactly why most process diagrams look like a plate of spaghetti.

Harry Beck went the opposite way. He created a set of **strict constraints** — and those very constraints are why his map works.

Today you'll learn Beck's four rules. And you'll never look at a flowchart the same way again.

## Rule 1: Only Three Angles (45°, 90°, 0°)

The first and most visible rule is about geometry.

On Beck's map, there are no soft curves. No "almost straight" lines. Every single line follows one of three angles:

- **Horizontal** (0°)
- **Vertical** (90°)
- **Diagonal** (45°)

### Why It Works

When your brain sees a gentle curve, it tries to interpret it. "Is that line turning east? Northeast? Almost north?"

But when the line simply goes 45° diagonally, the brain knows exactly what's happening. No ambiguity. No cognitive load.

### In Practice

Imagine a traditional flowchart of your invoicing process. Arrows wind like rivers through the landscape. Some go a bit left, others a bit right.

Now force it into Beck's rules:
- All arrows must go horizontal, vertical, or 45° diagonal
- No exceptions

Suddenly the process becomes readable. You can follow a line with your eyes without getting lost.

## Rule 2: Stations on an Invisible Grid

The second rule is about placement.

On Beck's map, all stations sit on an invisible grid. They don't land "roughly where they fit" — they snap to precise coordinates.

### Why It Works

Humans love patterns. When things are evenly distributed, they feel organized. When they're randomly scattered, they feel chaotic.

By forcing stations onto a grid, you get:
- Consistent spacing
- Predictable structure
- Easy scanning

### In Practice

Take your onboarding diagram. Now draw an invisible grid over it — let's say 10 columns and 8 rows. Every station must land on one of those 80 intersections.

This means you can't have "Station 5 just to the left of Station 4 but a bit higher." No. Station 5 is either one column to the right, or one row up. Precisely.

## Rule 3: Distances That Compress

Here comes the most counterintuitive rule:

**In MetroFlow, time and distance are irrelevant.**

If step 1 takes 5 minutes and step 2 takes 3 weeks, they have *the same visual distance* on the map.

### Why It Works

Traditional process diagrams often try to show "how long something takes" by making longer arrows. The result is that quick steps cluster in a corner while slow steps stretch across the entire page.

Beck said: "Put that information somewhere else. The map shows only sequence."

### In Practice

Your approval process has three steps:
1. Employee fills out form (2 min)
2. Manager approves (up to 5 days)
3. System registers (instant)

On a MetroFlow map, the three stations are equidistant from each other. Duration means nothing for the layout.

If you want to show duration, you can add it as a small number next to the station. But it doesn't affect placement.

## Rule 4: Interchanges Get Priority

The last rule is about visual hierarchy.

In Beck's system, stations where multiple lines meet (interchanges) get much more attention than regular stations.

- **Regular station:** Small tick mark on the line
- **Interchange:** Large white circle with black border

### Why It Works

Interchanges are *risk points*. This is where things can go wrong. This is where communication must work. This is where projects often stall.

By making them visually prominent, you force attention to where it needs to be.

### In Practice

In your process map, identify every point where:
- Responsibility shifts from person A to person B
- An approval is required
- Two departments must coordinate

These points become large white circles. Everything else is small tick marks.

When you look at the map, risk points light up like lighthouses.

## A Before/After Example: Request for Proposal

Let's take a classically messy process: **RFP handling** (Request for Proposal).

### Before (Traditional Flowchart)

- 23 boxes with different shapes
- Arrows crossing each other
- Three "decision diamonds" leading to six different paths
- Colors signaling "importance" (but no explanation)
- Text in fonts from 6pt to 12pt

**Result:** Nobody uses the diagram. Everyone asks a colleague.

### After (MetroFlow with Beck Rules)

- 4 lines (Sales, Legal, Tech, Finance)
- All lines at 45/90/0°
- 14 stations on a grid
- 3 interchanges marked as large circles
- Consistent font, consistent symbols

**Result:** A new employee can understand the process in 30 seconds.

## The Paradox of Constraints

Here's the truth that designers have always known:

**Constraints liberate creativity.**

When everything is allowed, you don't know where to start. When only three angles are allowed, it suddenly becomes about finding the smartest path within the rules.

Beck's constraints work not despite being strict. They work *because* they're strict.

---

## Your Exercise: Force a Flowchart Into the Rules

Find an existing process diagram in your organization. Something that looks messy. Something people avoid looking at.

Now redraw it with Beck's four rules:

1. **All lines at 45°, 90°, or 0°**
2. **All stations on a grid**
3. **All distances equal**
4. **All handovers as large circles**

You'll discover something remarkable: Just by forcing the layout, you'll see the process more clearly.

## Next Episode: Finding Your Bottlenecks

Now you have the rules. But what does the map actually tell you?

In the next episode, you'll learn to read a MetroFlow map like a detective:
- "King's Cross nodes" where everything converges
- "Circle Line loops" that never end
- "Aldwych dead ends" where processes die

Because once you can see the problems, you can solve them.
