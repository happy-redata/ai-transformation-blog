In the previous episode, we met Harry Beck — the man who revolutionized navigation by ignoring geography. He created a language that works for millions of passengers every day.

But what if we took that language and spoke it in the workplace?

Welcome to **the visual dictionary** — your guide to translating metro lines into business processes.

## The Translation: From Trains to Tasks

Imagine your company is a city. Each department is a neighborhood. Each process is a journey across that city.

Now think of it as a metro map:

| Metro Element | Business Equivalent | Visual Representation |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Line** | Department / Workflow | Thick colored line (e.g., Red = Sales, Blue = Finance) |
| **Station** | Task / Step | A simple tick on the line |
| **Interchange** | Handover / Approval | White circle where lines meet |
| **Zone** | Phase / Milestone | Faint background shading |
| **"You Are Here"** | Current Status | Pulsing indicator |

That's the entire dictionary. Five concepts. Infinite possibilities.

## A Real Example: Employee Onboarding

Let's look at a process most organizations know: **hiring and onboarding**.

### The Traditional Version (Chaos)

A typical onboarding flowchart looks like this:
- 47 boxes connected with arrows going every direction
- Dashed lines meaning "maybe"
- Colors that follow no logic
- Text so small you need a magnifying glass

The result? Nobody reads it. It gathers dust in a folder.

### The MetroFlow Version (Clarity)

On a MetroFlow map, onboarding becomes four colored lines:

**Red Line: HR Process**
- Station 1: Contract signed
- Station 2: Tax ID registered
- Station 3: Salary agreement approved
- *Interchange: IT handover*

**Blue Line: IT Setup**
- *Interchange: Received from HR*
- Station 4: User created in AD
- Station 5: Laptop ordered
- Station 6: Software installed
- *Interchange: Department receives*

**Green Line: Department Introduction**
- *Interchange: Received from IT*
- Station 7: Welcome meeting with manager
- Station 8: Buddy assigned
- Station 9: First project started

**Orange Line: Culture & Values**
- Station 10: Company culture intro
- Station 11: Security training
- Station 12: Lunch with CEO (tradition)

## The Magic of Interchanges

Notice the white circles — the **interchanges**. These are the places where responsibility changes hands.

In traditional flowcharts, these points are invisible. The arrow just continues to the next box.

In MetroFlow, they light up like warning signs:

> "A handover happens here. Something can go wrong here. Someone needs to actively receive the baton."

When you see two lines meeting at an interchange, you know two people (or teams) need to coordinate. Three lines? Even more complexity.

---

## The Zones: Invisible Milestones

Just like the London Tube has zones (Zone 1 is central, Zone 6 is suburbs), your processes have phases.

On an onboarding map, the zones might be:

- **Zone 1:** Before Day 1 (paperwork)
- **Zone 2:** First Week (setup)
- **Zone 3:** First Month (integration)
- **Zone 4:** First Quarter (evaluation)

Zones appear as faint colored backgrounds. They tell a new employee: "You're now in Zone 2 — everything is about setup."

---

## "You Are Here" — Real-Time Status

The last element is the most powerful: **the status indicator**.

On a physical metro map, you know where you are. But in a business process? It's often a mystery.

MetroFlow solves this with a pulsing marker:

> "Your new employee, Anna, is currently at Station 5 (Laptop ordered) on the Blue Line. She's waiting for delivery."

Suddenly, everyone can see where the process stands. No emails asking "what's the status?" No meetings to "sync up." The map shows the truth.

---

## Why This Works

Traditional flowcharts fail because they try to show everything:
- Every exception
- Every "what if"
- Every stakeholder

MetroFlow succeeds because it hides the unessential:
- You see the route, not the terrain
- You see the stops, not the seconds
- You see the connections, not the offices

---

## Your Exercise: Map Your First Workflow

Choose a simple process in your organization. Something with 5-10 steps. Maybe:
- Vacation request approval
- New equipment purchase
- Customer inquiry handling

Now think:
1. **Which lines (departments) are involved?**
2. **Which stations (steps) exist?**
3. **Where are the interchanges (handovers)?**

Just asking these questions will reveal hidden complexity.

## Next Episode: The Beck Constraints

Now you have the vocabulary. But how do you force a messy flowchart into Beck's tight geometry?

In the next episode, we dive into the four rules that create clarity:
- Lines at 45 degrees
- Stations on a grid
- Distances that compress
- Interchanges that get prioritized

Because constraints aren't the enemy. They're superpowers.
