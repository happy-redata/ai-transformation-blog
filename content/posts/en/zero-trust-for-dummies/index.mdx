<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
We live in a world where we download apps and extensions all the time. But do you actually know what you're letting in? I don't. That's why I have one simple rule: Trust no one.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

It's called **<Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice>**. It sounds complicated, but it's actually childishly simple.

## Why is my software suddenly suspicious?

<Speaker voice="narrator">
In the old days, we trusted everything that was \"inside the walls.\" If it was on the office network, it was safe. But today, walls no longer exist.
</Speaker>

When I install an extension like \"The <Voice text="Magic Button">Magic Button</Voice>,\" I have no idea if it starts peeking at my passwords over my shoulder. In a <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> world, software is always under suspicion—until it has proven otherwise.

## Software's Passport: The Manifest

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Just as you can't travel abroad without a passport, our software cannot run without its own. We call it a manifest.
</Speaker>

It's just a small text file (a <Voice text="Y.A.M.L.">YAML</Voice> file) that sits on the software's desk. It says exactly:
*   **Who I am:** The identity of the app.
*   **What I can do:** Which data and lists I'm allowed to touch.
*   **Where I can go:** Which networks I'm allowed to talk to.

If the software tries to do something not listed in the passport, it gets stopped immediately. No discussion.

## The Engine Room for Dummies

<Speaker voice="narrator">
The smart part is that we've automated the trust.
</Speaker>

When I change something in our <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> app, the system looks at the old passport and the new passport. If there's a difference, the system automatically makes the necessary changes (we call these <Voice text="Migrations">Migrations</Voice>). 

This means:
1.  **No unpleasant surprises:** Software never gets access to anything we haven't explicitly approved.
2.  **AI can help:** Because everything is described in the passport, the AI can help us check if everything is safe before we even hit \"Install.\"

## Cut to the bone

<Music track="conclusion" action="fade-in" />

<Speaker voice="narrator">
<Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> is not a technology. It's an attitude.
</Speaker>

It's about taking back control. By using a manifest, we ensure that our software always carries its passport—and that we know exactly who we're letting into our digital home.
