You've come a long way.

You've learned about Harry Beck's revolution. You've mastered the visual dictionary. You know the rules. You can spot bottlenecks like a detective.

Now it's time to build.

Welcome to the final episode: **Your guide to creating your first MetroFlow map from scratch.**

## Before You Start: Choose Your First Process

Not everything is suited for MetroFlow. Start with something that:

✅ Involves **2-4 departments** (enough complexity, but not too much)  
✅ Has **5-15 steps** (manageable size)  
✅ **Runs regularly** (so you can test if the map fits)  
✅ **Causes pain** (something that often fails or gets delayed)

**Good first processes:**
- Vacation request approval
- New employee onboarding
- Customer inquiry handling
- Equipment purchase

**Bad first processes:**
- The entire company's annual cycle
- "Everything IT does"
- Something that only happens once a year

## Step 1: Inventory Your Lines

The first step is identifying your "lines" — the departments or workflows involved.

### How to Do It:

1. Write all involved teams on sticky notes
2. Give each a color name (Sales = Red, Finance = Blue, etc.)
3. Create a simple legend

### Example: Purchase Approval

| Line | Color | Responsible |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Requester | 🔵 Blue | The employee |
| Department | 🟢 Green | Department manager |
| Procurement | 🟠 Orange | Procurement team |
| Finance | 🔴 Red | Finance department |

Four lines. Four colors. You have the foundation.

## Step 2: Plot Your Stations

Now list every single step in the process — without editing.

### How to Do It:

1. Write each step on a sticky note
2. Mark which line (color) the step belongs to
3. Lay them out in sequence (roughly — we'll fix the layout later)

### Example: Purchase Approval

**Blue Line (Requester):**
- Station 1: Identify need
- Station 2: Fill out requisition

**Green Line (Department):**
- Station 3: Department manager approves

**Orange Line (Procurement):**
- Station 4: Receive requisition
- Station 5: Find supplier
- Station 6: Get quotes
- Station 7: Place order

**Red Line (Finance):**
- Station 8: Receive invoice
- Station 9: Match with order
- Station 10: Pay supplier

Ten stations. You can already see the structure.

## Step 3: Mark Your Interchanges

Where does responsibility change? Those are your interchanges.

### How to Do It:

1. Find every point where work goes from one color to another
2. Mark that point as an interchange (large circle)
3. Give the interchange a name

### Example: Purchase Approval

- **Interchange A:** Between Station 2 (Blue) and Station 3 (Green) — *"For Approval"*
- **Interchange B:** Between Station 3 (Green) and Station 4 (Orange) — *"Approved Requisition"*
- **Interchange C:** Between Station 7 (Orange) and Station 8 (Red) — *"Invoice Received"*

Three interchanges. Three risk points.

## Step 4: Apply the Beck Rules

Now take your chaotic layout and force it into geometry.

### Rule 1: Only 45°, 90°, 0°
Draw a grid (10x10 works well). All lines must follow the grid lines or diagonals.

### Rule 2: Stations on Grid Points
Every station lands on an intersection in the grid. No "approximately" placements.

### Rule 3: Equal Distances
Whether the step takes 5 minutes or 5 days, the visual distance is the same.

### Rule 4: Large Circles for Interchanges
Regular stations = small tick marks. Interchanges = large white circles.

### Tools You Can Use:

| Tool | Level | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Pen and paper** | Beginner | Free |
| **Miro / FigJam** | Intermediate | Freemium |
| **Figma** | Advanced | Freemium |
| **draw.io** | All levels | Free |

Start with paper. Move to digital when you're happy with the structure.

## Step 5: Share and Iterate

Here's the truth: **Your first map will be wrong.**

And that's *exactly* the point.

### How to Do It:

1. **Print the map large** (A3 or bigger)
2. **Hang it on a visible wall**
3. **Invite colleagues to comment:**
   - "Is a step missing?"
   - "Is the sequence right?"
   - "Who actually has responsibility here?"
4. **Revise based on feedback**
5. **Repeat until the map matches reality**

Most processes require 2-3 iterations before the map reflects how things actually work.

## A Complete Example: Vacation Request

Let's build an entire map from scratch.

### The Lines:
- 🔵 Employee
- 🟢 Manager
- 🟠 HR

### The Stations:

**Blue Line:**
1. Employee checks vacation balance
2. Employee fills out request

**Interchange A:** *"For Approval"*

**Green Line:**
3. Manager reviews request
4. Manager approves/rejects

**Interchange B:** *"Approved Vacation"*

**Orange Line:**
5. HR records in system
6. HR updates payroll (if relevant)

### The Finished Map:

![MetroFlow example: Vacation Request](/posts/en/building-your-own-metroflow/metroflow-vacation-example.png)

Simple. Clear. Readable.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Much Detail
MetroFlow shows flow, not procedure. Put "sub-stations" in an appendix.

### ❌ Ignoring Interchanges
If you only have regular stations, you've missed the point. Find the handovers.

### ❌ Artificial Lines
If you have 10 lines, you have too many. Consolidate where you can.

### ❌ Never Updating
Processes change. The map should be updated at least once a year.

## What's Next?

You now have everything you need to:

1. **Speak the language** — stations, lines, interchanges
2. **Follow the rules** — 45°, grid, compression, prioritization
3. **Spot problems** — King's Cross, Circle Line, Aldwych
4. **Build maps** — inventory, plot, mark, apply, share

Your first map is waiting. Choose a process. Get started.

And remember: Harry Beck was rejected the first time. His map was called "too radical." A year later, it was a sensation.

Your map doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to be a *start*.

## Thank You for Following the Series

This was the final episode of **MetroFlow for Dummies**.

We hope you've gained:
- A new language for talking about processes
- A set of rules that create clarity
- Tools to see what others overlook

If you build a MetroFlow map, we'd love to see it. Share it with us — and maybe it will become an example in a future article.

*Which map will you build first? And what surprised you most in the process? We're curious.*
