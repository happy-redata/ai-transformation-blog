<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
Most organizations today suffer from "Document Death." Information dies in PDF files, drowns in SharePoint folders, or disappears in endless email threads. But what if you treated your entire organization as software?
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

Welcome to the world of **Everything as Code**.

<Music track="ambient-tech" action="fade-out" />

## What is "Everything as Code"?

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Simply put, Everything as Code (EaC) means we store all information – from bylaws and strategies to job descriptions and technical plans – as simple text files in a version-controlled system (like Git).
</Speaker>

It might sound nerdy, and it is. But it's precisely that nerdiness that is the superpower. 

When everything is code, we have:
1. **Full History:** Who changed what and when?
2. **One Source of Truth:** No doubt about which version of the strategy is the latest.
3. **Automation:** We can let machines read the code and automatically generate everything from websites to PDF documents.

## AI: The New Employee with X-ray Vision

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
But here's the real game-changer: AI loves code.
</Speaker>

<Emphasis type="strong">**If you give an AI 50 loose Word documents, it gets confused. If you give it a well-structured repository, it becomes brilliant.**</Emphasis>

Because everything is organized as code, the AI can have "X-ray vision" into the entire organization. It understands the connections between an HR decision, a technical plan, and the association's overall purpose because all the links are in the code.

## How We Organize Happy Mates

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Let's look at how we've done it with the Happy Mates association. We don't use folders filled with random files. We've built a structure that resembles a software project.
</Speaker>

<Emphasis type="soft">Without revealing the details of the content, our engine room looks like this:</Emphasis>

*   **Organization as a Tree Structure:** Everything from member management to investment strategies has its own dedicated place (its own "folder" in the code).
*   **Plans are Living Documents:** Strategies and roadmaps aren't static presentations. They are files that we continuously update, just as we update code.
*   **Automation as the Link:** We use scripts to take our "code" (the information) and transform it into the formats we need – whether it's an update to the website or a formal report.

<SoundEffect name="keyboard-typing" />

This workflow means that as a leader, I can brainstorm with my AI about *everything*. I can ask it to analyze the alignment between our bylaws and a new plan, or have it suggest an update to a job description based on our organizational structure.

## The Future is Text

<Music track="conclusion" action="fade-in" />

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Everything as Code isn't about making everyone a programmer. It's about giving the organization a shared, precise language that both humans and AI can understand.
</Speaker>

It's the foundation for being able to scale. It's the way we ensure that technology works for us, and not the other way around.

<Pause duration={1.5} />

<Emphasis type="question">**Is your organization ready to be read – and understood – by an AI?**</Emphasis>
