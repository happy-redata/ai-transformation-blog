If your company runs on Salesforce, you've probably heard this pitch:

"You don't need a separate low-code platform. Just extend Salesforce with Lightning."

And honestly? **They're not wrong.**

Salesforce Lightning is one of the most mature low-code platforms in existence. It's also deeply locked into the Salesforce ecosystem — for better and worse.

---

## What is Salesforce Lightning?

Lightning is Salesforce's modern UI framework and low-code development platform:

**Lightning Experience:** The user interface (replaced Classic in 2015)  
**Lightning App Builder:** Drag-and-drop page design  
**Flow Builder:** Visual workflow automation  
**Lightning Web Components:** Pro-code components that integrate with low-code

If Power Platform is Microsoft's low-code story, Lightning is Salesforce's answer.

## The Lightning Ecosystem

### Lightning App Builder

Build custom pages by dragging components:
- Standard components (charts, lists, related records)
- Custom Lightning Web Components
- Third-party AppExchange components

**What you can build:**
- Custom record pages
- App home pages
- Utility bars
- Community pages

### Flow Builder

Salesforce's automation engine — comparable to Power Automate:

**Flow types:**
- **Screen Flows:** Interactive, wizard-like experiences
- **Record-Triggered Flows:** When data changes
- **Scheduled Flows:** Time-based automation
- **Platform Event Flows:** Real-time integrations

**Strengths:**
- Deep Salesforce data access
- Complex branching logic
- Sub-flows for reusability
- Transaction control

### Lightning Web Components (LWC)

When declarative tools aren't enough:
- Modern JavaScript framework
- Reactive data binding
- Salesforce-optimized performance
- Reusable across pages

**Who uses LWC:** Developers who need custom UI beyond what App Builder provides.

## Salesforce vs. Power Platform

For organizations evaluating both:

| Dimension | Salesforce Lightning | Power Platform |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Best for** | CRM-centric organizations | M365/Azure shops |
| **Database** | Salesforce objects | Dataverse or SharePoint |
| **Automation** | Flow Builder | Power Automate |
| **Chatbots** | Einstein Bots | Copilot Studio |
| **Portals** | Experience Cloud | Power Pages |
| **Reporting** | Salesforce Reports | Power BI |
| **Ecosystem** | AppExchange | Microsoft AppSource |

**The reality:** If you're a Salesforce shop, Lightning is natural. If you're a Microsoft shop, Power Platform is natural. Mixing them creates integration complexity.

---

## When Lightning Shines

**CRM extensions:**
Adding fields, workflows, and pages to your Salesforce org.

**Sales process automation:**
Lead routing, opportunity updates, quote generation.

**Customer-facing portals:**
Partner portals, customer communities, self-service.

**AppExchange leverage:**
Thousands of pre-built solutions available.

---

## The Challenges

### 1. Cost Outside CRM

Salesforce licensing is expensive for non-CRM use cases:
- Platform licenses start around $25/user/month
- Full CRM licenses: $75-300/user/month
- Experience Cloud (portals): Additional per-login costs

**The trap:** Building non-CRM apps on Salesforce often costs more than alternatives.

### 2. Salesforce Skills Are Specialized

The talent pool for Salesforce development is:
- Smaller than general web development
- More expensive (certified admins command premiums)
- Has its own career ecosystem

**Reality check:** Finding Salesforce developers is harder and costlier than finding Power Platform or general developers.

### 3. The Declarative-vs-Apex Divide

Salesforce has two worlds:
- **Declarative:** Flow Builder, validation rules, formula fields
- **Apex:** Salesforce's proprietary programming language

When declarative reaches its limits, you need Apex. This requires developers — true "citizen development" has boundaries.

### 4. Platform Lock-In

Salesforce lock-in is severe:
- Custom objects don't export easily
- Flows don't transfer to other platforms
- Apex code is Salesforce-only
- Your data is in Salesforce's cloud

**Exit cost:** High. Plan for this.

---

## Flow Builder Deep Dive

Since automation is comparable to Power Automate, let's compare:

| Feature | Salesforce Flow | Power Automate |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Trigger types | Record, scheduled, platform event | Email, SharePoint, HTTP, 900+ |
| External connectors | Limited (use Apex for APIs) | 900+ connectors |
| Error handling | Built-in fault paths | Configure run-after |
| Debugging | Debug mode with step-through | Run history analysis |
| Reusability | Sub-flows | Child flows |
| Desktop automation | No native RPA | Desktop flows |

**Summary:** Flow Builder is powerful within Salesforce. Power Automate is more versatile for cross-system automation.

## Should You Choose Lightning?

**Yes, if:**
- Salesforce is your CRM
- Your use cases are CRM-adjacent
- You have Salesforce skills in-house
- AppExchange has solutions you need

**Probably not, if:**
- You're not already a Salesforce customer
- Use cases are outside CRM
- Budget is constrained
- You want to avoid vendor lock-in
