<Speak>Welcome to the third episode in the Agentic A-I for Dummies series. Today we learn about GitHub — the place where code lives, is collaborated on, and automatically deployed.</Speak>

You now have an <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> assistant in your editor. You can formulate good prompts. But something is missing:

*"Where do I save my code? How do I collaborate with others? How do I get my changes out into the world?"*

The answer is **GitHub** — and it's far more than just a place to store files.

## Repositories: Your Digital Workshop

A **repository** (or just "repo") is a folder for your project — but in the cloud. Think of it as:

- **A folder** with all your code
- **A time machine** that remembers all changes
- **A collaboration space** where multiple people can work simultaneously

At Happy Mates, we have many repositories:
- `happymates-blob` — this blog
- `happymates-api-core` — our <Voice text="A-P-I">API</Voice>
- `happymates-mobile` — our app

Each repository is an independent project with its own history, its own collaborators, and its own automation.

## Issues: Tasks With Superpowers

An **Issue** is more than a bug report. It's a work task with built-in context.

### What can an Issue contain?

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Title** | Short description of the task |
| **Description** | Details, requirements, context |
| **Labels** | Categorization (bug, feature, documentation) |
| **Assignee** | Who is working on it? |
| **Milestone** | Which version/sprint? |
| **Comments** | Discussion and updates |

### Issues as "Source of Truth"

The clever thing about Issues is that they gather everything in one place:

- What needs to be done?
- Who is doing it?
- What's the status?
- What was discussed?

When you close an Issue, you have a complete history of the task — from idea to solution.

---

## Pull Requests: Proposals for Changes

A **Pull Request** (or <Voice text="P-R">PR</Voice>) is a proposal to change the code. It's like saying:

*"Hey team, I've made something. Would you look at it and approve it becoming part of the project?"*

### The Anatomy of a Pull Request

1. **Title and description** — What and why
2. **Changes** — Exactly which files were edited
3. **Review** — Colleagues review the code
4. **Discussion** — Comments on specific lines
5. **Approval** — Green light from reviewers
6. **Merge** — The changes become part of the project

### Why not just change directly?

Imagine a team of 10 developers all changing the same file at the same time. Chaos!

Pull Requests provide:
- **Quality control** — Someone looks at the code before it goes to production
- **Documentation** — A history of what was changed and why
- **Rollback capability** — If something goes wrong, we can easily go back

---

## GitHub Actions: The Automated Factory

**GitHub Actions** is automation. When something happens in your repository, you can trigger actions.

### What can Actions do?

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New commit pushed | Run tests automatically |
| Pull Request created | Check code quality |
| <Voice text="P-R">PR</Voice> merged to main | Deploy to production |
| Daily at 9 AM | Run database backup |

### A simple example

At Happy Mates, we automatically run:
- **Linting** — Checks that the code follows our standards
- **Tests** — Verifies that everything works
- **Build** — Builds the production version
- **Deploy** — Sends to the server

All without us lifting a finger.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy
```

Every time we push to `main`, the blog is automatically built and deployed.

## How It All Fits Together

Here's the typical workflow in a professional project:

### 1. Create an Issue
*"Add dark mode to the front page"*

### 2. Create a Branch
A "branch" of the code where you can experiment without breaking anything.

### 3. Make your changes
Write code, test locally.

### 4. Create a Pull Request
*"Here's my implementation of dark mode"*

### 5. Code Review
Colleagues look at the code, ask questions, suggest improvements.

### 6. Adjust based on feedback
Maybe the reviewer catches a bug. You fix it.

### 7. Approve and Merge
The reviewer approves. The code becomes part of the project.

### 8. Actions run
Automatic test, build, deploy.

### 9. Issue closed
The task is complete. The history is documented.

<View>
The flow looks like this:

```
Issue → Branch → PR → Review → Merge → Action → Closed Issue
```

## Why Is This Important for <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> Development?

Here's the connection to our series:

> **GitHub isn't just for humans. It's also for <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> agents.**

In the next episode, you'll learn how to:
- Assign Issues to <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> agents
- Let the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> create Pull Requests
- Review and approve the <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice>'s work

GitHub is the infrastructure that makes agentic <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> possible in practice.

---

## Getting Started with GitHub

### 1. Create an account
Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up (free).

### 2. Create your first repository
Click "New repository", give it a name, and you're started.

### 3. Try GitHub Desktop
If the terminal seems scary, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a visual way to work with Git.

### 4. Experiment with Issues
Create an Issue in your own repository. Try closing it with a Pull Request.

## Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Repository** | Your project in the cloud |
| **Issue** | A task with context |
| **Pull Request** | A proposal for changes |
| **Code Review** | Quality control by colleagues |
| **Merge** | Include changes in the project |
| **Actions** | Automate everything |

---

**Bottom line:** GitHub isn't just version control. It's a complete platform for collaboration, quality, and automation. And as you'll see in the next episode, it's also home to <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> agents.

In the next (and final) episode, we dive into **Agentic <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice>** — how you assign tasks to <Voice text="A-I">AI</Voice> agents, chat with them along the way, and review their work like a colleague.
