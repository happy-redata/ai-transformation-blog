<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
Imagine you're buying a bottle of wine from an online store. How do you know it's really from France and not a counterfeit from someone's backyard? You look at the label, the control number, and maybe an official stamp. That's exactly the same principle that protects your software.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

Welcome to the second part of our **trust series**. Today it's all about **certificates** and **<Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>**.

<Music track="ambient-tech" action="fade-out" />

## The Passport: What Is a Certificate?

When you travel abroad, you need a **passport**. The passport proves your identity, and it's issued by an authority that other countries trust.

In the digital world, a **certificate** works exactly the same way.

<View>
![Digital Certificate](./diagram-digital-certificate.png)
</View>

<Speaker voice="narrator">
A certificate says: "I am who I claim to be, and here's the proof."
</Speaker>

### The Three Key Elements

| Element | Explanation | Passport Analogy |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Identity** | Who the certificate belongs to | Your name and photo |
| **Public Key** | A mathematical value for verification | Your passport number |
| **Signature** | Proof from a trusted authority | The official stamp |

<SoundEffect name="success-chime" />

## Certificate Authorities: Who Issues the Passports?

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
You can't just issue your own passport. You need an authority. The same goes for certificates.
</Speaker>

A **Certificate Authority** (CA) is a trusted third party that verifies identities and issues certificates.

<View>
![Certificate Authority Hierarchy](./diagram-ca-hierarchy.png)
</View>

Your browser comes with a list of **trusted Root CAs**. When you visit a website with HTTPS, the browser checks:

1. Is the certificate issued by a trusted CA?
2. Is it still valid (not expired)?
3. Does the domain name match?

If something fails, you see the famous **"Your connection is not private"** warning.

<Pause duration={1} />

## Code Signing: Software's Stamp

Certificates aren't just used for websites. They're also used to **sign software**.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
When you download an app, you trust that it comes from the developer. But how does your computer know?
</Speaker>

The answer is **code signing**:

1. The developer gets a certificate from a trusted CA
2. The developer signs the software with their private key
3. When you install, your computer verifies the signature

<View>
![Code Signing Process](./diagram-code-signing-flow.png)

<SoundEffect name="keyboard-typing" />

Without signing? Your computer will warn you about an "unknown developer" or block the installation entirely.

## <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>: Software's Ingredient List

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Now we're getting to something really important — and something most people have never heard of.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1} />

Think about a ready-made meal from the supermarket. On the back of the package, you'll find an **ingredient list**:

- Flour
- Sugar
- Eggs
- Preservative E211

If you're allergic to something, you can check the list.

**<Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>** (Software Bill of Materials) is the **ingredient list for software**.

### Why Is <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> Important?

<Speaker voice="narrator">
In December 2021, the Log4Shell vulnerability hit the world like a bomb.
</Speaker>

**Log4j** was a small logging library that almost nobody knew about. But it was hidden inside **millions** of applications:

- Minecraft
- Amazon Web Services
- Apple iCloud
- Tesla's systems

<SoundEffect name="dramatic-reveal" />

The problem? Most companies had no idea if they used Log4j. They had no ingredient list.

With an <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>, you can:

- **Check if you're vulnerable** when a new vulnerability is discovered
- **Trace the supply chain** back to the source
- **Prove compliance** to regulators and customers

<Pause duration={1.5} />

> **"You can't protect what you don't know you have."**

## The Supply Chain: From Developer to You

<Music track="transition-build" action="start" />

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Modern software isn't built from scratch. It's assembled from hundreds of components from around the world.
</Speaker>

Here's a typical **software supply chain**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN                          │
│                                                             │
│  👨‍💻 OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPER (in another country)            │
│    ↓ uploads                                                │
│  📦 NPM / PyPI / Maven (package repository)                │
│    ↓ includes                                               │
│  🏢 YOUR COMPANY'S DEVELOPER                               │
│    ↓ builds                                                 │
│  🔨 CI/CD PIPELINE (automated build)                       │
│    ↓ publishes                                              │
│  📱 APP STORE / DOWNLOAD PAGE                              │
│    ↓ installs                                               │
│  👤 END USER (you)                                         │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Every link in this chain is a potential attack point:

| Link | Risk |
|------|------|
| Open source developer | Malicious code, hijacked account |
| Package repository | Typosquatting, fake packages |
| Build pipeline | Compromised CI server |
| Distribution | Man-in-the-middle attack |

## How to Protect Your Supply Chain

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
It sounds scary, but there are concrete things you can do.
</Speaker>

<SoundEffect name="success-chime" />

### 1. 🔐 Verify Signatures
Always check that software is signed with a valid certificate.

### 2. 📋 Require <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>
Ask your vendors for an ingredient list. It's now a requirement for US federal contracts.

### 3. 🔍 Scan for Vulnerabilities
Use tools like **Dependabot**, **Snyk**, or **Trivy** to scan your dependencies.

### 4. 📌 Pin Your Versions
Use specific version numbers, not "latest version."

### 5. 🔒 Enable Two-Factor
Protect your accounts on npm, GitHub, and other repositories.

## Summary

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Certificate** | Digital passport that proves identity |
| **CA** | Authority that issues certificates |
| **Code Signing** | Proof of software's origin |
| **<Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>** | Ingredient list for software |
| **Supply Chain** | All links from developer to user |

**Bottom line:** A certificate proves who built your software. An <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> reveals what's inside. Together, they give you the trust to know what you're installing.
