We are at the beginning of an incredibly exciting year. 2026 will be the year where **Happy Mates Society** truly takes root and starts creating value for young people with neurodiverse profiles.

Here is an overview of what will happen in the next three months (January - March 2026).

## January: Establishment and Visibility

January is dedicated to **establishment**. The most important agenda item is our **founding general assembly** at the beginning of the month. Here we will formally elect the board, adopt our bylaws, and lay the foundation for the association's structure.

But we don't stop at paperwork. In week 3, we move out to **HF Helsingør**. Here we will present Happy Mates and our "Petit Knit for IT" concept to students in the 2nd and 3rd year of the IN line. The goal is to spark curiosity and find the first potential candidates who want to join us in building something great.

After that, we take a well-deserved holiday break in weeks 4 and 5 to recharge for the recruitment phase.

## February: Recruitment and Team Formation

February is the month where we find our **Mates**.

After the holiday, we start our recruitment process. We have developed a unique admission test that is not about grades, but about the ability to solve problems with modern tools. Candidates will be given access to our GitHub organization and asked to solve a project using GitHub Copilot.

-   **Duration:** One week.
-   **Evaluators:** Noah & Mikkel.
-   **Goal:** To admit 4-8 dedicated members.

We are looking for young people who have the spark and who can see the value in combining professional immersion with physical activity.

## March: Kick-off and Playitas

On **March 1st**, it really kicks off!

### Activities Start
We start our fixed rhythm with activities twice a week:
*   **Tuesday:** Strategy & Planning. Here we dive into projects and set the course.
*   **Thursday:** Production & Outreach. Here we execute and reach out to the world.

### Playitas Sales
At the same time, the starting signal goes for the sale of spots for our Playitas trip. We have an ambitious goal of selling 10 spots by mid-June, which will ensure a revenue of 250,000 DKK for the association. In March, we aim to reach halfway with 5 sold spots.

These revenues are crucial for us to operate our "social-economic" model and ensure we have the funds for social work, equipment, and shared experiences.
