<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
There's a spreadsheet in your company that no one talks about openly. It lives in a shared folder somewhere, or maybe on Jan's desktop. It gets updated every Friday. It controls something absolutely critical—maybe shift schedules, maybe pricing calculations, maybe your entire project finances.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

<SoundEffect name="dramatic-reveal">And if Jan gets sick, the department panics.</SoundEffect>

Welcome to reality in most companies.

<Music track="ambient-tech" action="fade-out" />

## Excel: The Company's Unofficial Operating System

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Let's start with an uncomfortable truth: It's estimated that up to 50% of all work processes in companies run *outside* the official systems. They live in spreadsheets, in Word documents, in Outlook rules that someone set up in 2014 and never touched again.
</Speaker>

<SoundEffect name="keyboard-typing" />

Excel isn't just a spreadsheet program. It's the glue that holds companies together. It's "shadow IT" in its purest form—solutions that employees have built themselves because they needed something IT couldn't deliver fast enough.

And let's be honest: <Emphasis type="soft">We've all done it.</Emphasis> It's not a problem in itself. It's a symptom of something deeper: A gap between what the business needs and what technology can deliver.

## From DIY to Low Code to Vibe Coding

<Music track="transition-build" action="start" />

We've tried to close this gap before.

First came the "Do It Yourself" wave. Then Low Code. Then No Code. Tools that promised everyone could build apps without knowing how to program. And they worked—to some extent. They gave us more spreadsheets. Just with prettier interfaces.

<SoundEffect name="slide-transition" />

The problem was that we accepted half-solutions. We built something that "worked," but wasn't *right*. Something that required manual workarounds. Something that broke down when reality got complex.

Now we're at a new wave: <Emphasis type="dramatic">**Vibe Coding**.</Emphasis>

<Pause duration={1} />

It sounds like a buzzword. It is, a bit. But the core is real: With modern AI tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot Agents, and similar, we can now build software by *describing* what we want. Not by writing code line by line. But by communicating with an assistant that understands the intention.

<Music track="transition-build" action="fade-out" />

## The Message for Leaders: Don't Accept Half-Solutions

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Here's the part you might not want to hear:
</Speaker>

<Emphasis type="strong">**AI is not a place where everyone can individually create the cool solutions.**</Emphasis>

It's tempting to believe it. "We'll buy a ChatGPT license for everyone, and the problems solve themselves." <SoundEffect name="buzzer-wrong">No. They don't.</SoundEffect>

Using AI to transform your technology requires *someone* to dedicate themselves to it. It requires focus. It requires treating it like any other strategic investment.

<Pause duration={1.5} />

But here's what you get in return:

<Emphasis type="dramatic">**You can use AI to make your technology perfect.**</Emphasis>

<SoundEffect name="success-chime" />

Not "good enough." Not "it works most of the time." *Perfect*. Solutions that actually cover the entire business need. That don't require manual workarounds. That don't break down when Jan is sick.

## Measure Success in Killed Spreadsheets

<Music track="conclusion" action="fade-in" />

My recommendation? Start by measuring something completely concrete:

<Emphasis type="question">**How many spreadsheets can you kill?**</Emphasis>

Every spreadsheet that's replaced by a real solution is a victory. Every manual process that becomes properly automated is a release of human time and energy.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
It's not a question of whether you should use AI. It's a question of how you do it right.

And it starts with stopping accepting half-solutions.
</Speaker>

*In the next posts in this series, we'll dive into the specific tools—from Lovable and v0.app to Supabase and GitHub Copilot Agents—and show how they can be used to build real solutions. We'll also talk about the overarching ambition: Breaking free from Big Tech and self-hosting what's critical for your company.*
