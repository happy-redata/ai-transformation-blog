You've learned the language. You've learned the rules. Now comes the real magic:

**Reading a MetroFlow map like a detective.**

Because when you know what to look for, the map reveals everything. Bottlenecks. Dead ends. Loops that never finish. It's all there — if you know where to look.

Today you'll learn the three patterns that reveal problems in any organization.

## Pattern 1: The King's Cross Node

If you know the London Tube, you know that King's Cross is a nightmare.

Six lines meet in one place:
- Northern Line
- Piccadilly Line
- Victoria Line
- Circle Line
- Metropolitan Line
- Hammersmith & City Line

During rush hour, it's chaos. Too many people. Too few platforms. Any delay on one line spreads to all the others.

### What It Means in Your Organization

When you see four or more lines converging at a single interchange on your MetroFlow map, you've found a **King's Cross node**.

This is typically a person, system, or department that:
- Must approve everything from everyone
- Depends on input from many sources
- Is a single point of failure

**Real-World Examples:**

- **The CFO's signature:** Everything over $10,000 needs CFO approval. Four departments wait for that signature.
- **Legal department:** All contracts must go through the same two lawyers. The entire sales department waits.
- **IT systems:** All data must pass through the legacy ERP. It has a queue.

### What You Do About It

When you identify a King's Cross node, you have three options:

1. **Add capacity:** More platforms = more staff or systems to handle traffic
2. **Divert traffic:** Can some lines take a different route? (delegation, alternative approvers)
3. **Reduce stops:** Does every line really need to stop here? (raise thresholds, remove unnecessary steps)

## Pattern 2: The Circle Line Loop

The Circle Line in London is famous for one thing: **It never stops.**

You can sit on the train all day and just ride in circles. There's no terminus.

### What It Means in Your Organization

When you see lines on your MetroFlow map that curve back to an earlier station, you've found a **Circle Line loop**.

These are typically processes that:
- Never really finish
- Require repeated approvals
- Send work "back to start" at the slightest error

**Real-World Examples:**

- **The budget exercise:** Department creates budget → CFO rejects → Department revises → CFO rejects again → (repeat infinitely)
- **Feedback hell:** Document sent for review → Reviewer has comments → Author revises → Reviewer has *new* comments → (loop continues)
- **Approval ping-pong:** Manager approves → HR rejects → Manager appeals → HR considers → (no decision is made)

### What You Do About It

Circle Line loops require an **exit criterion**. Ask:

1. **What defines "done"?** Write it down. Make it measurable.
2. **How many iterations are allowed?** Set a limit. Three attempts = escalation.
3. **Who has authority to break the loop?** Give someone mandate to say "this is good enough."

## Pattern 3: The Aldwych Dead End

Aldwych was a station on the London Tube that closed in 1994. The line went there — and then nothing more.

No connection to other lines. No reason to go there. A dead end.

### What It Means in Your Organization

When you see lines on your MetroFlow map that just... stop... without connecting to anything, you've found an **Aldwych dead end**.

These are typically processes that:
- Nobody uses anymore (but still exist)
- Were never properly integrated
- Produce output that nobody reads

**Real-World Examples:**

- **The report nobody reads:** Every month someone produces a 40-page report. It's sent to a distribution list. Nobody has read it in three years.
- **The abandoned system:** Data is entered into an old system "because we've always done it." No downstream process uses the data.
- **The meeting without purpose:** Every Wednesday, five people meet. They take notes. The notes are filed. No action follows.

### What You Do About It

Aldwych dead ends have only one solution: **Shutdown or integration.**

1. **Ask:** "Who uses the output from this process?"
2. **If the answer is 'nobody':** Stop the process
3. **If the answer is 'someone':** Figure out how to connect the process to their needs

## How to Read the Map Like a Detective

Now you have three patterns to look for. Here's your checklist:

### 1. Scan for Large Circles
Where are the interchanges? The more lines that meet, the higher the risk.

### 2. Follow Lines That Curve Back
Do you see loops? Draw a circle around them. These are potential time thieves.

### 3. Find Lines That Stop
Does the line end in something meaningful? Or just... nothing?

### 4. Count the Colors at Each Interchange
- 2 colors = manageable
- 3 colors = complex
- 4+ colors = warning

## A Concrete Example: Customer Service Process

Let's analyze a typical customer service flow:

**The Lines:**
- Blue: Customer Inquiry
- Green: Technical Support
- Orange: Billing
- Red: Escalation

**What the Map Reveals:**

1. **King's Cross node:** All three lines (Blue, Green, Orange) meet at "Support Manager." She approves escalations, technical solutions, AND refunds. Too much.

2. **Circle Line loop:** Technical support sends cases back to customer service "for more information" → Customer service collects info → Sends back → Technical support finds something new that's missing → (loop).

3. **Aldwych dead end:** "Customer satisfaction survey" sent after every call. Results captured in a spreadsheet that's never analyzed.

**Solutions:**
- Give support staff mandate to resolve themselves (reduce King's Cross)
- Define exactly what "enough information" means (break Circle Line)
- Either use survey data for something, or stop sending them (close Aldwych)

## Your Exercise: Analyze a Map

Take a MetroFlow map you've created (or make a new one for a simple process).

Now answer:

1. **Where are your King's Cross nodes?** (Four+ lines meet)
2. **Where are your Circle Line loops?** (Lines that curve back)
3. **Where are your Aldwych dead ends?** (Lines that stop at nothing)

Just identifying them is half the solution.

## Next Episode: Build Your Own MetroFlow

You have the language. You have the rules. You can read the patterns.

In the final episode, we bring it all together: A step-by-step guide to building your first MetroFlow map from scratch.

* Inventory
* Layout
* Approval
* Iteration

Your map won't be perfect. That's the point. For the first time, you'll see what to fix.
