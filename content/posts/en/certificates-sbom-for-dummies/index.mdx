<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
Imagine you buy a sandwich. You read the ingredient list: bread, chicken, lettuce, dressing. But what if the list just said "sandwich content"? Would you still eat it?
</Speaker>

Welcome to episode 2 of our series on **trust in the digital world**. Today, we're talking about the documents that prove who software is — and what it contains.

<Music track="ambient-tech" action="fade-out" />

## The Invisible Web of Trust

Every time you open an app, download an update, or visit a website, you rely on an invisible network of **digital certificates**.

<View>See the illustration below — from you to the server, data passes through many layers of trust:</View>

![The trust network — from user to server through certificate-verified connections](/images/trust-chain-diagram.png)

Certificates are the software's **passports**. They prove:
- **Who** made the software
- **That** the software has not been changed during transit
- **When** the certificate expires

## What Is a Certificate?

<Speaker voice="narrator">
A digital certificate is like a notarized document. A trusted third party — a <Voice text="Certificate Authority">Certificate Authority</Voice> or <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice> — confirms that the owner is who they say they are.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1} />

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Owner's identity** | Who the certificate belongs to (company, domain, person) |
| **Public key** | Used to verify signatures |
| **Issuer's signature** | The <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice> confirms the validity |
| **Expiration date** | Certificates are only valid for a limited period |

<SoundEffect name="keyboard-typing" />

When you visit a secure website and see the padlock in the browser bar, the browser has verified the website's certificate against a list of trusted <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice>s.

## The Trust Chain in Certificates

Certificates form a **chain** — just like the trust chains we discussed in episode 1.

<View>Here's how the trust chain works:</View>

1. **Root <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice>** — The top authority, built into your operating system
2. **Intermediate <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice>** — Issues certificates on behalf of the Root <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice>
3. **Server Certificate** — The specific certificate for the website or software

> **"If just one link in the chain is compromised, the entire trust collapses."**

## When Certificates Fail

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Certificates are not infallible. Here's what can go wrong:
</Speaker>

<SoundEffect name="dramatic-reveal" />

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|------------|
| **Expired certificate** | Browsers show a warning, users cannot access the service |
| **Stolen private key** | Attackers can impersonate the legitimate owner |
| **Compromised <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice>** | All certificates from that <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice> are untrustworthy |
| **Self-signed certificate** | No third party has verified the identity |

In 2011, the Dutch <Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice> **DigiNotar** was compromised. Hackers issued fake certificates for Gmail, Yahoo, and others. The result? The entire company shut down.

## <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>: The Ingredient List of Software

Now for the second half of the equation: **<Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>** — Software Bill of Materials.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Modern software is like a sandwich. You see the finished product, but inside there are hundreds of ingredients — <Voice text="open source">open source</Voice> libraries, <Voice text="frameworks">frameworks</Voice>, and components from all over the world.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

An <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> is a complete list of all these ingredients.

<View>Here's a simplified example of what an SBOM contains:</View>

| Component | Version | License | Vulnerability? |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| react | 18.2.0 | MIT | None |
| lodash | 4.17.20 | MIT | ⚠️ CVE-2021-23337 |
| express | 4.18.2 | MIT | None |
| log4j | 2.14.1 | Apache 2.0 | 🚨 CVE-2021-44228 |

<SoundEffect name="alert-warning" />

## <Voice text="Log 4 Shell">Log4Shell</Voice>: Why <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> Matters

In December 2021, the world was hit by **<Voice text="Log 4 Shell">Log4Shell</Voice>** — a catastrophic vulnerability in <Voice text="Log Four J">Log4j</Voice>, a popular <Voice text="Java">Java</Voice> library for logging.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Millions of systems were suddenly vulnerable. But here was the problem: most companies didn't even know they were using <Voice text="Log Four J">Log4j</Voice>.
</Speaker>

The library was buried deep in the dependency tree — a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.

<View>See how dependencies can hide:</View>

```
Your App
  └── Framework A (v3.2.1)
        └── Utility B (v1.4.0)
              └── log4j (v2.14.1) ← 🚨 VULNERABLE!
```

<Pause duration={1} />

**With an <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>**, you could instantly search and find all systems using <Voice text="Log Four J">Log4j</Voice>. Without it? Weeks of manual searching.

## Why Should You Care?

| If you are a... | <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> helps you... |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Developer** | Know your dependencies and their vulnerabilities |
| **<Voice text="I.T.">IT</Voice> Manager** | React quickly to new security threats |
| **Compliance Officer** | Document software composition for authorities |
| **End User** | Know that the provider takes security seriously |

## Certificates + <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> = Complete Trust

<Music track="conclusion" action="fade-in" />

Certificates prove **who** made the software.
<Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> reveals **what** is in the software.

<View>Here’s how the two work together:</View>

| Question | Answer from |
|-----------|----------|
| Who made this software? | Certificate |
| Is the software unchanged? | Certificate Signature |
| What does the software contain? | <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> |
| Are there known vulnerabilities? | <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> + CVE Database |

Together, they provide a **complete picture** of your software's trust profile.

<Pause duration={1} />

## Summary

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|
| **Certificate** | Digital passport proving identity |
| **<Voice text="C.A.">CA</Voice>** | Trusted authority issuing certificates |
| **<Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>** | Complete ingredient list for software |
| **Trust Chain** | Sequence of verified connections |

**Bottom Line:** You cannot protect yourself against threats you don't know. Certificates and <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice>s give you visibility — and visibility is the first step toward security.
