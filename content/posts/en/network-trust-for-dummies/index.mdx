<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
Imagine two cities. The first is a medieval fortress with thick walls, a moat, and a single guarded gate. The second is a modern metropolis with open roads, WiFi everywhere, and visitors from around the world. Which is safer? The answer depends on what you're protecting.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

Welcome to the third and final part of our **trust series**. Today we're exploring **network trust** — from total isolation to the open internet.

<Music track="ambient-tech" action="fade-out" />

## The Spectrum: From Fortress to Open City

Network security isn't about "secure" versus "insecure." It's a **spectrum** with many levels.

```

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Each level has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore them all.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1} />

## Level 1: Air Gap — The Isolated Fortress

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
The most secure network isn't connected to anything else at all.
</Speaker>

An **air-gapped** system has no connection to the internet or other networks. Literally, there is "air" between the system and the outside world.

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Where is it used?
- **Nuclear power plants** and critical infrastructure
- **Military systems** and intelligence agencies
- **Financial trading systems** (certain parts)
- **Medical devices** in hospitals

### Pros
- ✅ Nearly impossible to hack remotely
- ✅ No malware can "phone home"
- ✅ Maximum control over data

### Cons
- ❌ Updates require physical access
- ❌ Difficult to collaborate and share data
- ❌ USB devices become the weak point

<SoundEffect name="dramatic-reveal" />

**Reality:** In 2010, the **Stuxnet** worm showed that even air-gapped systems could be attacked — via an infected USB drive.

<Pause duration={1} />

## Level 2: Closed Network — The Fortress with One Gate

The next level is a **closed network** — physically connected internally, but without direct internet access.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Where is it used?
- Internal business systems
- Manufacturing plants (OT networks)
- Schools and educational institutions (certain networks)

### Pros
- ✅ Internal collaboration is possible
- ✅ No external attack surface
- ✅ Easier to control who has access

### Cons
- ❌ Limited functionality
- ❌ If one machine is compromised internally, the attack spreads easily
- ❌ The "inside the walls = trust" problem

## Level 3: VPN + Firewall — The Fortress with a Drawbridge

<Speaker voice="narrator">
Most businesses are here. They have a firewall protecting the perimeter and use VPN to let employees "tunnel" in.
</Speaker>

```

### How does VPN work?
1. You start an encrypted tunnel to the company network
2. Your traffic goes through this tunnel
3. The firewall sees you as an "internal" user
4. You get access to everything internal

### The Problem
<SoundEffect name="buzzer-wrong" />

Once you're "inside" via VPN, the system trusts you. It's the classic "castle" model:

- If your laptop is compromised, the attacker now has **full access**
- Lateral movement (hopping from system to system) is easy
- VPN credentials become targets for phishing

<Pause duration={1} />

> **"VPN solves the problem of getting in. It doesn't solve the problem of what happens once someone is inside."**

## Level 4: Zero Trust — Every Door Has Its Own Guard

<Music track="transition-build" action="start" />

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Here's the paradigm shift. Zero Trust abandons the castle model and says: "Never trust, always verify."
</Speaker>

### Zero Trust Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Verify explicitly** | Authenticate and authorize based on all available data points |
| **Least privilege** | Only give access to what's necessary — nothing more |
| **Assume breach** | Design as if the network is already compromised |

### Example: Accessing a file

**Castle model (VPN):**
1. Log in via VPN ✅
2. Access to all files on the server ✅

**Zero Trust:**
1. Is the user who they claim to be? (MFA) ✅
2. Is the device compliant? (Updated, encrypted) ✅
3. Does the user have specific access to this file? ✅
4. Is it normal for the user to access this file at 3 AM from Russia? ❌

<SoundEffect name="success-chime" />

### Who uses Zero Trust?
- Google (BeyondCorp)
- Microsoft (all internal systems)
- Financial institutions
- Healthcare (growing adoption)

## Level 5: Open Internet — The Free City

<Speaker voice="narrator">
At the other end of the spectrum, we have the open internet — no fortress, no walls, everyone can come and go.

```

### Where is it used?
- Public websites
- APIs for third parties
- SaaS products

### How do you protect yourself?
Even though the service is "open," it still requires:
- **HTTPS** — Encrypted connection
- **Rate limiting** — Limit the number of requests
- **WAF** — Web Application Firewall
- **Authentication** — For sensitive actions
- **Monitoring** — Logs and alerts

## Comparison Table

<View>Here's a complete comparison:</View>

| Level | Security | Flexibility | Typical Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 🏰 Air Gap | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | Critical infrastructure |
| 🔒 Closed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | Manufacturing plants |
| 🌐 VPN | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Traditional enterprises |
| 🔍 Zero Trust | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Modern enterprises |
| 🌍 Open | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Public services |

## What's Right for You?

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
There isn't one right answer. It depends on what you're protecting.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1} />

### Questions to ask:

1. **What's the consequence of a breach?**
   - National security → Air Gap
   - Business secrets → Zero Trust
   - Public information → Open with protection

2. **How flexible does the system need to be?**
   - Collaboration with externals → Zero Trust or open
   - Internal users only → Closed or VPN

3. **What's your budget and resources?**
   - Zero Trust requires investment in identity management
   - VPN is cheap but has limitations
   - Air Gap requires physical security

## The Hybrid Reality

<Music track="conclusion" action="fade-in" />

<Speaker voice="narrator">
In practice, most organizations use a **combination** of levels.
</Speaker>

Example of a modern enterprise:

- **Air Gap**: Backup systems, critical encryption keys
- **Zero Trust**: Daily business applications
- **Open**: Company website and marketing

## Trust Series Summary

| Topic | Key Insight |
|-------|-------------|
| **Trust (Part 1)** | The chain is only as strong as its weakest link |
| **Certificates (Part 2)** | Passports prove identity, <Voice text="S-BOM">SBOM</Voice> reveals contents |
| **Networks (Part 3)** | Choose security level based on risk and needs |

<Pause duration={1} />

---

**Bottom line:** There isn't one "right" security level. It's about matching protection with what you're protecting — and remembering that Zero Trust isn't a product, it's a philosophy.
