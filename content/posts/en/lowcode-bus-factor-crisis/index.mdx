Let me tell you about Lars.

Lars is 62. He's been with the company for 30 years. When Power Apps came out, he was enthusiastic. Excel wizard that he was, he immediately saw the potential.

Over the past 5 years, Lars built:
- 47 Power Apps (Canvas and Model-Driven)
- 94 Power Automate flows
- 12 Power BI reports
- Countless Dataverse customizations

Every department loves Lars. He solved their problems. He built apps that actually work.

**Lars just announced his retirement.**

And suddenly, everyone is asking the same question:

> *"Who understands Lars's apps?"*

The answer: **No one.**

## The Bus Factor

In software engineering, there's a metric called the **bus factor**:

> *How many people would need to be hit by a bus before the project is in serious trouble?*

If the answer is "one" — you have a problem.

For most citizen-developed low-code apps, the bus factor is exactly one.

**One person:**
- Understands the logic
- Knows the data sources
- Remembers the business rules
- Has the admin credentials

When that person leaves — through retirement, new job, illness, or yes, an actual bus — the knowledge leaves with them.

## What Lars Took With Him

Let's inventory what Lars's departure means:

### 1. Undocumented Logic

Lars knew *why* each formula was written:
- "This filter excludes inactive customers because..."
- "We skip this step when the amount is under 1000 because..."
- "The complex date logic handles fiscal years differently because..."

None of this is documented. The formulas work, but nobody knows why.

### 2. Tribal Knowledge

Lars knew the *context*:
- "This app was built because finance needed it after the merger"
- "Don't touch the connection to the legacy ERP — it's fragile"
- "The CEO uses this dashboard every Monday; don't change it"

This context exists only in Lars's head.

### 3. Connection Secrets

Lars set up the service accounts:
- The email address for automated notifications
- The API key for the external service
- The shared mailbox credentials

Some of these are in Lars's personal password manager. Others are in his memory.

### 4. Dependency Maps

Lars knows which flows trigger which apps:
- "If you change this SharePoint list, these 7 flows break"
- "This Canvas app uses data from that Model-Driven app"
- "These 3 reports depend on that table being updated daily"

No one else can trace these connections.

## The Day After Lars Leaves

Here's what typically happens:

**Week 1:**
"Everything seems fine. Lars left notes, right?"
(Lars left a 2-page Word document that's already outdated.)

**Week 3:**
"The finance app stopped working. Can someone look at it?"
(Nobody knows where to start. The error message is cryptic.)

**Week 6:**
"We need to add a field to the customer form."
(Someone makes a change. It breaks three other apps unexpectedly.)

**Month 3:**
"We should just rebuild this app."
(The rebuild takes 6 months because nobody understood the requirements the first time.)

**Year 1:**
"We still have 30 of Lars's apps running. We're afraid to touch them."

## The Real Cost

Let's quantify the Lars problem:

| Impact | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Time spent reverse-engineering | 200+ hours over first year |
| Production outages | Unknown — depends on app criticality |
| Rebuilt applications | 3-6 months each |
| Consultant fees to untangle | €50-150/hour |
| Lost productivity during transition | Significant |

For an organization with dozens of citizen-developed apps, the total cost of single-person dependency can reach **hundreds of thousands of euros**.

## The Warning Signs

How do you know you have a Lars problem?

**Red flags:**
- "Only \[name\] understands that system"
- "Don't update that app — we don't know how it works"
- "The documentation is in \[person\]'s head"
- "We've been meaning to have someone else learn that..."
- "If \[person\] leaves, we're in trouble"

If you're nodding, you have a bus factor problem.

## The Solutions (Before It's Too Late)

### 1. Documentation Standards

**Minimum for every app:**
- What does it do? (purpose)
- Who uses it? (users)
- What data sources? (connections)
- What automations? (flows)
- Who owns it? (accountability)

### 2. Pair Building

Never let one person be the sole expert:
- Two people learn every app
- Code reviews (yes, even for low-code)
- Handover sessions recorded

### 3. Regular "Explain Your App" Sessions

Quarterly: Each app owner presents to a colleague:
- Walk through the logic
- Explain the design decisions
- Document questions that arise

This forces documentation and spreads knowledge.

### 4. The "Hit by a Bus" Test

For every app, ask:
> *If the owner disappeared tomorrow, could someone else fix this on Monday?*

If no — that app is a risk. Prioritize documentation.

### 5. Succession Planning

Before someone leaves:
- Formal knowledge transfer period
- Shadow sessions
- Updated documentation
- Admin credential handover

Don't wait until the retirement announcement.

## The "3-2-1 Rule"

At Happy Mates, we enforce a simple rule for any business-critical app:

- **3** people understand how it works
- **2** people can make changes
- **1** person is accountable for it

This ensures the bus factor is never one.

## Starting the Conversation

If you recognize your organization in this story, here's how to start:

1. **Inventory your apps** — Who built them? Who understands them?
2. **Identify single-person dependencies** — Which apps have a bus factor of one?
3. **Prioritize by criticality** — Focus on business-critical apps first
4. **Start documenting** — Even basic documentation is better than none
5. **Plan for transitions** — Every builder should have a backup

## Next Episode

The Bus Factor is about people. Episode 13 is about the *documentation debt* they leave behind — and how to pay it down before it's too late.
