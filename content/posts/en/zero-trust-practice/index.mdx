<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
You've read about <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice>. You understand the concept. But now you're facing the hard part: implementing it without your colleagues starting to hate you.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

Welcome to episode 3 of our series on **trust in the digital world**. Today, we go from theory to practice.

<Music track="ambient-tech" action="fade-out" />

## The Problem with "Perfect Security"

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Here's the truth that no security experts will say out loud: The most secure computer is one that is turned off, buried in concrete, and thrown into the sea.
</Speaker>

But that's not exactly useful.

Security is always about **balance** — between protection and usability.

<View>See the dilemma visualized:</View>

| More security | Consequence |
|---------------|------------|
| Login at every action | Frustrated users |
| Complex passwords | Post-its on screens |
| No external devices | Productivity loss |
| <Voice text="V.P.N.">VPN</Voice> for everything | Slow performance |

> **"Security that is too cumbersome will be bypassed."**

<Pause duration={1} />

## The Four Pillars of <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice>

<Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> rests on four principles. Let's go through them — and how you implement them in practice.

### 1. Verify Explicitly

**Principle:** Never trust a user's identity based on location or network. Always verify.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
In the old world, you were "safe" when you were on the office network. In <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice>, you are never automatically safe.
</Speaker>

<View>Practical implementation:</View>

| Action | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **<Voice text="M.F.A.">MFA</Voice> on everything** | Require <Voice text="two-factor authentication">2FA</Voice> for all systems |
| **Contextual login** | Check location, device, time |
| **<Voice text="Single Sign-On">Single Sign-On</Voice>** | One strong login, centrally managed |
| **Passwordless** | Biometrics or hardware keys instead of passwords |

<SoundEffect name="success-chime" />

**Quick win:** Activate <Voice text="M.F.A.">MFA</Voice> on all cloud services. Microsoft reports a 99.9% reduction in account compromises.

### 2. Use Least Privilege

**Principle:** Give access only to exactly what the user needs — no more.

<Pause duration={1} />

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| "Everyone has access to everything" | Role-based access control (<Voice text="R.B.A.C.">RBAC</Voice>) |
| Admin rights for everyone | Just-in-time administration |
| Permanent rights | Time-limited access |
| Unused accounts | Automatic deactivation after X days |

<Speaker voice="narrator">
It's like giving a hotel key that only opens your own room — not the whole hotel.
</Speaker>

**Quick win:** Review admin accounts. Does everyone who has them still need them?

### 3. Assume Breach

**Principle:** Design systems as if the hacker is already inside.

<SoundEffect name="dramatic-reveal" />

This is the mindset shift. Instead of focusing all energy on keeping the enemy out, you prepare for what happens when they get in.

<View>Practical implementation:</View>

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Segmentation** | Divide the network so a breach doesn't spread |
| **Encryption everywhere** | Encrypt data at rest AND in transit |
| **Logging and monitoring** | Know exactly who does what, when |
| **Incident Response plan** | Practice what you do when (not if) it happens |

**Quick win:** Activate detailed logging on critical systems. You cannot investigate what you haven't recorded.

### 4. Continuous Validation

**Principle:** Don't just verify at login — verify continuously.

<Pause duration={1} />

A session can start legitimately and be compromised along the way. That's why <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> validates continuously.

| Signs of compromise | Action |
|------------------------|----------|
| Login from a new country | Require extra verification |
| Unusual activity | Automatic warnings |
| Massive data download | Temporary blocking |
| Old software | Require update before access |

## Happy Mates in Practice: Software Control

At Happy Mates, we take <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> a step further with what we call **Software Control**.

Instead of us as administrators having to manually guess what an app needs in terms of access to <Voice text="Share Point">SharePoint</Voice>, the app brings its own "passport" in the form of a `manifest.happymate.data.yaml`.

<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
Think of it as a customs declaration. The app arrives at the system and says: "Here I am, and here are exactly the lists and fields I need to read and write in."
</Speaker>

### The Manifest: The App's "Passport"

Here is an excerpt of what such a declaration looks like:

```yaml
# manifest.happymate.data.yaml
version: "1.0.0"

# Declaration of business entities
entities:
  - name: "Projects"
    internalName: "hm_projects"
    fields:
      - name: "Title"
        type: "Text"
        required: true
      - name: "Status"
        type: "Choice"
        choices: ["Active", "Archived", "Planned"]

# Automatic changes (Migrations)
migrations:
  - id: "001_initial"
    description: "Creation of project list"
    operations:
      - type: "createList"
        entity: "Projects"
```

### Why it's top-class <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice>:

1. **Explicit Trust:** The app *only* gets access to the lists it has declared. It's "Least Privilege" in code form.
2. **Automation:** The system automatically compares the old manifest with the new one. If the app asks for a new field, the system creates it — but only if it's approved.
3. **Immutability:** We always know exactly which version of the data structure is running because it's stored as code (Everything as Code).

## Implementation Phases

<Music track="ambient-tech" action="fade-in" />

You cannot implement <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> in one day. Here is a realistic roadmap:

### Phase 1: Visibility (Months 1-2)

<Speaker voice="narrator">
You cannot protect what you cannot see. Start by mapping.
</Speaker>

- Who has access to what?
- Which systems talk to which?
- Where is your critical data?
- What is your current security level?

**Output:** Complete inventory and risk mapping.

### Phase 2: Identity (Months 3-4)

- Implement <Voice text="M.F.A.">MFA</Voice> on all accounts
- Consolidate identities into one system
- Establish <Voice text="Single Sign-On">Single Sign-On</Voice>
- Clean up old accounts

**Output:** One source of truth for user identity.

### Phase 3: Access Control (Months 5-6)

- Implement role-based access
- Remove unnecessary privileges
- Establish just-in-time admin access
- Document access policies

**Output:** Least privilege as standard.

<Pause duration={1} />

### Phase 4: Segmentation (Months 7-9)

- Divide the network into zones
- Implement micro-segmentation where possible
- Encrypt all internal traffic
- Establish application-level control

**Output:** Limited blast radius in case of a breach.

### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

- Regular penetration tests
- Red team/blue team exercises
- Rule updates
- Employee training

## Avoid Typical Mistakes

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Here's what makes <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> projects fail:
</Speaker>

<SoundEffect name="alert-warning" />

| Mistake | Consequence | Solution |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Too fast, too much** | User frustration, workarounds | Incremental rollout |
| **No management support** | Budget disappears, project dies | Involve leadership from day one |
| **Ignoring user experience** | People find ways around it | Test with real users |
| **Technology only, no culture** | Security becomes "someone else's problem" | Training and awareness |
| **No measurements** | Cannot prove the value | Define KPIs from the start |

## Gains You Can Show Management

| Metric | Before <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> | After <Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice> |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Account compromises | Monthly | Rare |
| Time to detect breach | Months | Hours |
| Spread radius upon breach | Entire network | Isolated zone |
| Compliance audit | Hectic scramble | Continuous documentation |
