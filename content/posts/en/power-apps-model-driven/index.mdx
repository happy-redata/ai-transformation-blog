Forget the blank canvas.

Model-Driven Apps don't start with screens. They start with a question: **What data does your business need to track?**

Define your tables. Define your relationships. Define your business rules.

And then? **The app builds itself.**

---

## The Philosophy Shift

If Canvas Apps are for designers, Model-Driven Apps are for architects.

| Canvas Apps | Model-Driven Apps |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "What should it look like?" | "What data do I need?" |
| You design every screen | Platform generates screens |
| Any data source | Dataverse required |
| Pixel-perfect control | Standardized components |
| Quick prototypes | Long-term enterprise apps |

This isn't better or worse. It's a fundamentally different approach.

## One Requirement: Dataverse

Here's the first thing you need to know: **Model-Driven Apps require Dataverse.**

There's no connecting to a SharePoint list. No pointing at an Excel file. Model-Driven Apps are built on top of Dataverse — Microsoft's managed database for the Power Platform.

**Why this matters:**
- Dataverse has licensing costs (see Episode 8)
- Dataverse provides enterprise features (security, audit, backup)
- Your data model becomes the foundation of everything

If you're not ready to commit to Dataverse, stick with Canvas Apps.

## Data First: Designing Your Model

Before you touch the app designer, you build your data structure.

### Example: Customer Service System

**Tables (Entities):**
- Customers
- Cases
- Products
- Knowledge Articles

**Relationships:**
- A Customer has many Cases (1:N)
- A Case relates to one Product (N:1)
- A Case can link to many Knowledge Articles (N:N)

**Columns (Fields):**
Each table gets columns with types:
- Text (single line, multiple lines)
- Number (whole, decimal, currency)
- Date/Time
- Choice (dropdown)
- Lookup (reference to another table)

Once your data model exists, you can build the app.

## The App Designer Experience

Model-Driven Apps are built through a visual designer — but you're not placing buttons. You're composing:

### Sitemap (Navigation)
Define the menu structure:
```
Service
├── Dashboard
├── Cases
├── Customers
└── Knowledge Base
```

### Forms
Each table can have multiple forms:
- **Main form:** Full edit experience
- **Quick create:** Pop-up for fast data entry
- **Quick view:** Summary card for related records

### Views
Pre-filtered lists of records:
- "My Active Cases"
- "High Priority Cases"
- "Cases Opened This Week"

### Business Process Flows
Visual guidance through stages:
```
New Case → Investigate → Resolve → Close
```

---

## What You Control (and What You Don't)

### You Control:
- Which tables appear in navigation
- Which columns show on forms
- The order and grouping of fields
- Business rules (field visibility, validation)
- Views and their filters
- Security roles

### You Don't Control:
- The overall layout framework
- Core navigation behavior
- Form rendering engine
- Mobile experience (it's responsive by default)

This is the trade-off. You lose design freedom. You gain consistency and maintainability.

---

## Built-in Enterprise Features

Model-Driven Apps come with capabilities that Canvas Apps require manual implementation:

### Automatic Mobile Support
Every Model-Driven App has a mobile experience. The platform adapts your forms and views automatically.

### Security Model
Dataverse provides row-level security:
- Users see only records they own
- Teams share access
- Hierarchies roll up permissions
- Field-level security for sensitive data

### Audit Trail
Every record change is logged:
- Who changed it
- When
- What changed
- Previous values

### Business Rules
Declarative logic without formulas:
- Show/hide fields based on values
- Set default values
- Make fields required
- Lock fields based on conditions

## Real-World Use Cases

Model-Driven Apps shine for:

**CRM-style applications:**
- Customer management
- Opportunity tracking
- Account management

**Case management:**
- Support ticketing
- Incident handling
- Service requests

**Asset tracking:**
- Equipment management
- Inventory control
- Fleet management

**Complex data relationships:**
- Product catalogs with variants
- Hierarchical organizations
- Multi-party transactions

---

## When Model-Driven Struggles

There are cases where Canvas Apps are better:

**Highly custom UIs:**
If you need a specific visual design that doesn't fit the standard form layout, Canvas wins.

**Simple data collection:**
For a quick survey or inspection form, Model-Driven is overkill.

**External users:**
Model-Driven Apps are designed for licensed internal users. For public-facing apps, use Power Pages or Canvas.

**Limited budget:**
Dataverse costs money. If budget is tight, SharePoint + Canvas might be sufficient.

---

## The Hybrid Approach

Here's a secret: You can embed Canvas Apps inside Model-Driven Apps.

**Why this matters:**
- Use Model-Driven for the structure and governance
- Embed Canvas components for custom visuals
- Get the best of both worlds

Example: A Model-Driven case management app with an embedded Canvas map component showing customer locations.

## Building Your First Model-Driven App

### Step 1: Create a Dataverse table
- Go to make.powerapps.com
- Create a new table (e.g., "Cases")
- Add columns: Title, Description, Status, Priority

### Step 2: Create a Model-Driven App
- Choose "Model-driven app"
- Use the modern designer
- Add your table to the sitemap

### Step 3: Customize forms and views
- Drag columns onto the form
- Create views like "My Active Cases"
- Add a business process flow

### Step 4: Set security
- Create security roles
- Assign access levels per table
- Add users to roles

### Step 5: Publish and share
- Hit Publish
- Share the app with your security roles
- Users access via web or mobile

## Migration Path: Canvas to Model-Driven

If you've outgrown your Canvas App:

1. **Export your data model** — Document all your data sources
2. **Create Dataverse tables** — Migrate your SharePoint lists to Dataverse
3. **Build forms in Model-Driven** — Recreate your key screens as forms
4. **Migrate business logic** — Convert Power Fx to business rules
5. **Re-train users** — The UX is different

This is not trivial. Plan for weeks, not days.
