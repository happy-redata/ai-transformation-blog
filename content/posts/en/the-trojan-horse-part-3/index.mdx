We have looked at the horse. We have looked at the maid. But now we must go back to the start. Back to the forest where the wood was felled.
</Speaker>

In the previous two articles, we discussed the symptoms: A compromised device. But the real solution lies in preventing the horse from ever being built.

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
Welcome to the finale of our series on The Trojan Horse. Today we talk about Supply Chain Integrity.
</Speaker>

## What is your "horse" made of?

When you buy software or hardware, you rarely buy one product. You buy thousands of small parts assembled together.

Imagine baking a cake for your boss. You buy flour, eggs, sugar, and chocolate.
If the flour is poisoned, it doesn't matter that you washed your hands.

In the IT world, we call the ingredient list an **SBOM** (<Voice text="S-Bom">SBOM</Voice>) – Software Bill of Materials.

The <Voice text="S-Bom">SBOM</Voice> tells you exactly:
1.  Which library is used for login?
2.  Who coded the encryption?
3.  How old is the database?

Without this list, you are eating blind.

## Traceability: From Forest to Gate

Securing your supply chain is about setting requirements **before** you buy.

### 1. Demand transparency
Ask your suppliers: "Where do your components come from?" If they can't answer, that's a red flag.

### 2. Check the seal
On hardware, look for physical signs of tampering. Is the box broken? Is the "tamper tape" cut?

### 3. Know your risk
Not all gifts need a thorough inspection. If you are buying coffee pods, the risk is low. If you are buying servers for the defense department, the risk is existential.

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
The Trojans didn't fail because they were stupid. They failed because they were grateful. They accepted a gift without asking for the receipt.
</Speaker>

## Conclusion: Zero Trust applies to gifts too

We have learned three things in this series:
1.  **Hardware can lie** (Part 1).
2.  **Physical access is king** (Part 2).
3.  **You must know the ingredients** (Part 3).

In a world of Zero Trust, we trust nothing – not even gifts. We verify. We check. And sometimes... we just leave the horse outside.

Thanks for reading. Do you have your <Voice text="S-Bom">SBOM</Voice> under control, or are you eating blind?
