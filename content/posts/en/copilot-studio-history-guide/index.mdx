"Have you tried our new Power Virtual Agent?"

If someone said this to you in 2020, they meant a simple chatbot with decision trees.

"Have you tried our new Copilot?"

If someone says this in 2025, you need to ask: **Which Copilot?**

Welcome to the most rebranded product in Microsoft's history — and the most transformed.

---

## The Complete Timeline

Let's trace every step of this evolution:

### May 2019: Power Virtual Agents Launches

Microsoft enters the no-code chatbot market.

**What it did:**
- Build bots without code
- Decision tree conversations
- "If user says X, respond with Y"
- Deploy to websites and Teams

**The reality:** Simple FAQ bots. Great for IT helpdesks answering "How do I reset my password?" Not great for complex conversations.

### 2020-2022: Gradual Improvements

PVA got smarter:
- Better natural language understanding
- Integration with Power Automate
- Bot building in Teams directly
- More channels (Facebook, websites, custom)

But fundamentally, it was still decision trees. If the user went "off script," the bot got confused.

### November 2023: The Big Rebrand

Microsoft announces: Power Virtual Agents is now **Copilot Studio**.

**What changed:**
- Generative AI integration (GPT-powered responses)
- Build custom Copilots, not just bots
- Connect to your enterprise data
- Extend Microsoft 365 Copilot with plugins

**The messaging shift:**
- **Before:** "Build chatbots"
- **After:** "Build AI agents and custom Copilots"

### 2024: AI Agents Go Mainstream

Copilot Studio becomes the hub for enterprise AI agents:
- Autonomous task completion
- Multi-turn reasoning
- Integration with Graph API, SharePoint, Dataverse
- Custom GPTs with enterprise data

### 2025: The Present State

Today, Copilot Studio can:
1. **Answer questions** from your documents and data
2. **Execute actions** via Power Automate
3. **Extend Microsoft 365 Copilot** with custom skills
4. **Operate autonomously** with human approval gates
5. **Deploy anywhere** — Teams, web, mobile apps

## The Naming Confusion

Here's the current Microsoft Copilot landscape:

| Product | What It Is | Where You Find It |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Microsoft 365 Copilot** | AI assistant in Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook | Included in M365 Copilot licenses |
| **Copilot Studio** | Platform to *build* custom Copilots | make.powerapps.com |
| **GitHub Copilot** | AI coding assistant | GitHub/VS Code |
| **Copilot in Power Platform** | AI features in Power Apps/Automate | Built into the tools |
| **Windows Copilot** | OS-level assistant | Windows 11 |
| **Bing Copilot** | Web chat | bing.com/chat |

When someone says "Copilot," **always ask which one**.

---

## What Copilot Studio Actually Does Today

### 1. Build Custom Copilots

Create AI assistants for specific domains:
- **HR Copilot:** Answer employee policy questions
- **IT Copilot:** Troubleshoot tech issues
- **Sales Copilot:** Provide product information

Each Copilot can:
- Access your documents (SharePoint, OneDrive)
- Query your databases (Dataverse, SQL)
- Execute actions (Power Automate flows)

### 2. Extend Microsoft 365 Copilot

Build plugins that add capabilities:
- "Book a meeting room" (connects to room booking system)
- "Check inventory levels" (connects to ERP)
- "Submit expense report" (connects to finance system)

These appear inside the Microsoft 365 Copilot interface.

### 3. Create Conversational Interfaces

The "classic" chatbot use case:
- FAQ bots
- Service desk assistants
- Product recommendation engines
- Appointment booking systems

Now powered by generative AI, not just decision trees.

### 4. Deploy Autonomous Agents

The cutting edge:
- Agents that work independently
- Human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive actions
- Multi-step task completion
- Scheduled operations

## The Architecture

Understanding how Copilot Studio works:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 USER INTERFACE                  │
│    (Teams, Web Chat, Custom App, M365 Copilot) │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                      │
┌─────────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│              COPILOT STUDIO AGENT               │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │         CONVERSATION LOGIC              │   │
│  │   • Topics (conversation flows)         │   │
│  │   • Generative AI responses            │   │
│  │   • Entity extraction                   │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                      │
         ┌────────────┴────────────┐
         │                         │
┌────────▼────────┐    ┌──────────▼──────────┐
│  KNOWLEDGE       │    │    ACTIONS           │
│  • SharePoint    │    │    • Power Automate  │
│  • Dataverse     │    │    • HTTP calls      │
│  • Websites      │    │    • Plugins         │
│  • Documents     │    │    • Custom APIs     │
└──────────────────┘    └─────────────────────┘
```

### Topics
Conversation flows that guide the interaction:
- Trigger phrases: "I need help with..."
- Questions: "What's your employee ID?"
- Conditions: If status = Active, then...
- Actions: Call Power Automate flow

### Knowledge Sources
Where the Copilot finds answers:
- SharePoint sites
- Dataverse tables
- Uploaded documents
- Public websites
- Custom APIs

### Actions
What the Copilot can do:
- Send emails
- Create records
- Trigger workflows
- Call external systems

## Building Your First Copilot

### Step 1: Define the Purpose
"An IT help desk assistant that answers common questions and can reset passwords."

### Step 2: Add Knowledge Sources
- Upload your IT FAQ documents
- Connect to your SharePoint site with IT policies

### Step 3: Create Topics
**Topic: Password Reset**
- Trigger: "reset password," "forgot password," "can't log in"
- Response: "I can help you reset your password. Please confirm your email address."
- Action: Call Password Reset flow in Power Automate

### Step 4: Configure Generative AI
- Enable "Boost conversations with generative AI"
- The Copilot will answer questions from your knowledge sources even without explicit topics

### Step 5: Deploy
- Add to Teams as a bot
- Embed on your IT portal
- Share the web link

## Pricing Reality

Copilot Studio has complex pricing:

| Component | Cost Model |
|-----------|------------|
| **Messages** | Per message (tenant pools) |
| **Sessions** | Per session (25 messages = 1 session) |
| **Premium features** | Require additional capacity |

**The reality:** For light usage, the included capacity with Power Platform licenses might suffice. For enterprise-scale deployment, expect significant costs.

Check Microsoft's current pricing — it changes frequently.

## When Copilot Studio Makes Sense

**Great for:**
- FAQ automation with document-backed answers
- Simple task automation (reset password, check status)
- First-line support deflection
- Guided data collection

**Struggles with:**
- Complex multi-system orchestrations
- High-volume transaction processing
- Scenarios requiring 100% accuracy
- Deep integration with legacy systems

---

## The Pro-Code Alternatives

If Copilot Studio isn't enough:

| Need | Consider |
|------|----------|
| Complex dialog management | Azure Bot Framework |
| Custom LLM integration | Azure OpenAI Service |
| High-volume agents | Build custom with Semantic Kernel |
| Full control over AI behavior | Custom development |

Copilot Studio is the low-code entry point. Pro-code options offer more control.

## Next Episode

In Episode 8, we tackle the elephant in the room: **Dataverse costs**. How much does Microsoft's database really cost? When is it worth it? And when should you stick with SharePoint?
