<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
Imagine you are a king in the 16th century. You are hungry, and servants are bringing in great platters of roast and wine into the Great Hall. It smells heavenly. But you dare not take a bite.
</Speaker>

<Pause duration={1.5} />

Because what if the cook has been bribed by your arch-enemy? Just one sip of wine could be your last.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
That is why you have a **Cupbearer**. A person whose only job is to taste everything before it touches your lips. If he falls over, you know to skip the main course.
</Speaker>

## Your Digital Cupbearer

Today, we don't have knights and castles, but the problem is the same. We invite strangers into our digital kingdoms every day: Emails, apps, links, and logins.

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
In the modern world, the Cupbearer is not a person. It is what we call **Identity Protection** and **Conditional Access**.
</Speaker>

When you log into your work, an invisible Cupbearer stands there checking:
1.  **Is it the right wine?** (Is your password correct?)
2.  **Does the wine come from a good vintage?** (Is the login from a known device?)
3.  **Is the cork pulled correctly?** (Did you use <Voice text="M.F.A.">MFA</Voice>?)

If something tastes wrong – *if you log in from China at 3 AM* – the Cupbearer knocks the glass out of your hand. Access denied.

## Trust is Something You Earn

In the old days, it was about blind trust in the Cupbearer. Today, it is about **<Voice text="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</Voice>**.

<Speak>
Zero Trust means, simply put: Trust nothing, verify everything.
</Speak>

Just as the Cupbearer tasted *every single* glass – not just the first one – our security systems must check us *every single* time we ask for access to a new file or system. It isn't mistrust; it is professional security.

## What Can History Teach Us?

<SoundEffect name="success-chime" />

<Speaker voice="narrator">
The Cupbearer was the most important person at court. He literally stood between life and death. In your company, the Identity team are your modern Cupbearers.
</Speaker>

So next time your phone asks you to approve with the *Authenticator* app, think of the poor Cupbearer who risked his life for the king. You just have to press a button.

<Emphasis type="question">**Have you remembered to thank your digital Cupbearer today?**</Emphasis>
