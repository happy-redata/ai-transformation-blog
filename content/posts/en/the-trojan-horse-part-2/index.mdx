<Speaker voice="narrator" name="Narrator">
You are on a business trip. You check into the hotel, drop your bags, and put your laptop on the desk. You just need to go down to the bar to meet a colleague.
</Speaker>

It only takes 30 minutes. The door is locked. You have the key card in your pocket.

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
But when you come back, someone has been there. Not to steal the computer. But to change it.
</Speaker>

## The Scenario: 5 Minutes Alone

This is called an **Evil Maid** attack. The name comes from the idea of the hotel maid who has the key to your room. We trust her. But what if she isn't there to change the towels?

When you leave your computer in a hotel room – or in an unlocked meeting room – you are giving an attacker the most valuable thing of all: **Physical access**.

<Voice text="Hollywood has taught us">Hollywood has taught us</Voice> that hackers sit in dark basements, hammering away at keyboards to break through firewalls.

The reality is often simpler: They plug a USB drive into your computer while you get coffee.

## What happens?

If your computer is just closed (in "Sleep" mode), the encryption key is still in the memory (RAM).

1.  **The attacker enters.**
2.  **She wakes the computer.**
3.  **She inserts a special USB device.**
4.  **The device copies the contents of the memory – including your passwords.**

It takes just a few minutes. When she leaves, everything looks untouched.

<Speaker voice="narrator">
But the next time you log in, the computer sends your secrets directly to her.
</Speaker>

## The Solution: Shut It Down

How do you protect yourself against the evil maid?

It is about making physical access useless.

### 1. Full Disk Encryption
You must use **FileVault** (on Mac) or **BitLocker** (on Windows). This ensures your data is gibberish without the code.

### 2. Shut Down
When you leave the computer in an insecure place, do not just close the lid. You must turn it off completely.

<Speaker voice="host" name="Host">
When the power goes, the keys disappear from memory. A turned-off computer is a silent computer.
</Speaker>

### 3. Find Waldo
If you are paranoid (or work with very sensitive data), you can use "Tamper-evident" nail polish on the screws. Then you can see if someone has opened the case.

## Trust is good, control is better

We live in a world where we have to trust others. The courier, the cleaner, the receptionist. But we don't have to give them the keys to the kingdom.

**The next time you leave your computer at a café to go to the restroom... will you take it with you?**
