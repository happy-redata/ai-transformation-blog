"Just use Dataverse. It's the right way to do it."

You'll hear this advice constantly in Power Platform circles. And it's not wrong — Dataverse is genuinely powerful. It provides features that would take months to build yourself.

But there's a question that often goes unasked: **How much does "the right way" actually cost?**

Let's find out.

---

## What is Dataverse?

First, a refresher. Dataverse (formerly "Common Data Service") is:

**A managed relational database** — Tables, columns, relationships  
**With built-in security** — Row-level, field-level, role-based  
**And business logic** — Validation rules, calculated fields, workflows  
**Exposed via APIs** — Every table automatically gets REST endpoints  
**With audit trails** — Every change logged  
**And backup/restore** — Enterprise-grade reliability

Dataverse is essentially "Azure SQL + security + business rules + APIs" bundled into one managed service.

**Why Microsoft pushes it:** It's the foundation for Model-Driven Apps, Dynamics 365, and increasingly everything in Power Platform.

## The Cost Components

Dataverse pricing has multiple dimensions:

### 1. Database Capacity

This is the core storage cost:

| Tier | Price (approximate) |
|------|---------------------|
| Database storage | ~€40/GB/month |
| File storage | ~€2/GB/month |
| Log storage | ~€10/GB/month |

**What counts as database storage:** Your actual data — rows in tables, metadata  
**What counts as file storage:** Attachments, images, documents  
**What counts as log storage:** Audit trails, plugin traces

**The baseline:** Every tenant gets a small amount of "included" capacity (typically 1-10 GB depending on licenses). After that, you pay per GB.

### 2. User Licensing

Users need licenses to access Dataverse:

| License Type | Approximate Cost | Dataverse Access |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Power Apps per app | ~€5/user/month | Access via 2 specific apps |
| Power Apps Premium | ~€20/user/month | Unlimited apps |
| Dynamics 365 (various) | €40-200/user/month | Included |

**The trap:** "Power Apps included in Microsoft 365" gives you Canvas Apps with SharePoint — **not Dataverse**.

### 3. API Request Units

Every API call to Dataverse consumes "request units":

| License | Included Requests |
|---------|-------------------|
| Per app | 2,000/day per user |
| Premium | 40,000/day per user |

Hit the limit? Requests get throttled or fail.

## Real-World Cost Scenarios

Let's calculate some realistic scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Small Team App

**Setup:**
- 10 users
- 1 GB data
- Power Apps per-app licensing

**Monthly cost:**
- Licensing: 10 × €5 = €50/month
- Storage: Included in base capacity
- **Total: ~€50/month**

Verdict: **Reasonable.** Comparable to many SaaS alternatives.

### Scenario 2: Department Solution

**Setup:**
- 50 users
- 5 GB data
- 2 GB files
- Power Apps Premium licensing

**Monthly cost:**
- Licensing: 50 × €20 = €1,000/month
- Database storage: 5 GB × €40 = €200/month (if over included)
- File storage: 2 GB × €2 = €4/month
- **Total: ~€1,200/month**

Verdict: **Significant.** That's €14,400/year for one department's app.

### Scenario 3: Enterprise Deployment

**Setup:**
- 500 users
- 50 GB data
- 100 GB files
- Mix of licensing

**Monthly cost:**
- Licensing: Varies (€10,000-50,000/month range)
- Additional storage: Significant
- **Total: Can easily exceed €100,000/year**

Verdict: **Enterprise budget required.** Plan carefully.

## The Hidden Costs

Beyond the obvious pricing, watch for:

### 1. Storage Growth

Data grows. Attachments accumulate. Logs expand.

Year 1: 5 GB  
Year 2: 15 GB  
Year 3: 40 GB

Plan for storage costs to increase 2-3x annually.

### 2. Environment Sprawl

Each Dataverse environment has its own capacity allocation:
- Development environment
- Test environment
- Production environment
- Sandbox environments

More environments = more base costs.

### 3. Migration Exit Costs

If you ever want to leave Dataverse:
- Data export is possible but not trivial
- Business logic doesn't transfer
- Relationships need rebuilding
- You're essentially starting over

The switching cost is high.

## When Dataverse Makes Sense

Dataverse is worth the investment when:

**Model-Driven Apps are needed**
- No choice — they require Dataverse
- The governance features justify the cost

**Complex data relationships**
- Many-to-many relationships
- Hierarchical structures
- Multi-entity processes

**Enterprise security requirements**
- Row-level security
- Field-level security  
- Comprehensive audit trails

**Integration with Dynamics 365**
- Same database, seamless integration
- Shared security model

**Long-term strategic applications**
- Core business processes
- Systems you'll use for 5+ years

## When to Avoid Dataverse

Save your money when:

**Simple data needs**
- SharePoint lists work fine for basic apps
- Excel files suffice for simple data

**Cost sensitivity**
- Limited budget
- Can't justify per-user licensing

**Short-term projects**
- Proof of concepts
- Temporary applications

**External user scenarios**
- Power Pages has its own licensing model
- Consider alternatives for public-facing apps

---

## Alternatives Within Power Platform

### SharePoint Lists

**Cost:** Included with Microsoft 365  
**Capacity:** 30 million items per list  
**Best for:** Simple data, document-centric apps

**Limitations:**
- No row-level security (only list-level)
- Limited relationship support
- No business rules engine

### SQL Server / Azure SQL

**Cost:** Varies (existing infrastructure or Azure pricing)  
**Best for:** Existing database investments, complex queries

**Limitations:**
- Requires Premium connectors
- Security model is on you
- No built-in business logic

### Excel / OneDrive

**Cost:** Included with Microsoft 365  
**Best for:** Very simple apps, personal productivity

**Limitations:**
- Concurrent access issues
- Limited capacity
- No enterprise features

## The Decision Framework

Use this to decide:

```
Is Model-Driven App required?
    └── YES → Dataverse (no choice)
    └── NO ↓

Do you need row-level security?
    └── YES → Dataverse or build custom security
    └── NO ↓

Are there complex relationships?
    └── YES → Dataverse or Azure SQL
    └── NO ↓

Is this a strategic, long-term app?
    └── YES → Consider Dataverse
    └── NO ↓

Budget constrained?
    └── YES → SharePoint or existing databases
    └── NO → Your choice
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

If you're committed to Dataverse:

### 1. Right-size licensing
- Use per-app licenses for limited-access users
- Reserve Premium for power users

### 2. Archive old data
- Move historical data to cheaper storage
- Keep only active records in Dataverse

### 3. Minimize environments
- Share development environments when possible
- Clean up unused sandboxes

### 4. Monitor usage
- Use Power Platform Admin Center analytics
- Identify and address storage growth

### 5. Consider hybrid approaches
- Keep high-volume data in Azure SQL
- Use Dataverse for the business layer

## The Ferrari Metaphor

Here's how we think about it:

> **Dataverse is a Ferrari.**  
> It's fast. It's beautiful. It has incredible engineering.  
> But you don't buy a Ferrari to commute to the grocery store.

If your use case demands enterprise features, Dataverse delivers. If you just need to track a list of items, a Ferrari is overkill.

**Choose the right vehicle for the journey.**
